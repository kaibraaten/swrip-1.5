A Landspeeder~
This old SoroSuub landspeeder seats 4 people comfortably. Landspeeders
empoy a repulsorlift engine allowing them to hover suspended about a meter
off the ground. This affect continues even after they are shut down.
Landspeeders are also referred to as floaters or skimmers.  
 
Speeders can be driven with: DRIVE <DIR>

This is a small Sorosuub speeder designed for quick travel throught busy
city streets. It can only hold two people due to its small size. This
speeder has been proframed with a small radar that allows it to move
