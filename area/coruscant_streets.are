A Cheap Hotel~
This old hotel looks to be relatively safe, if not clean.  The rates are
cheap at least.   The walls are made of a synthetic wood material, and the
floor is covered with a dirty brown carpet. Behind an old fashioned desk
is an assortment of keycards sealed behind a more modern energy shield.   

 This would be a good place to rest for a while.  You may quit and
re-enter the game from here.

&R&GIntersection&R&W - &R&GManarai Spaceport Entrance&R&W/&R&GCoruscant Streets Entrance&R&W.~
The intersection connecting Manarai Spaceport to the rest of Coruscant and
vice versa is completely overcrowded with hundreds of various species and
races intermixing to form a large mobile crowd, each citizen going their
different ways. All around the intersection is towering skyscrapers and
other buildings, casting large shadows over the street. Natural
illumination is impossible due to the numerous amount of buildings which
block the sunlight; lamp posts are installed on every corner and emit a
natural white light which runs all day, every day, without failure.  A
marketplace is to the southeast and southwest, and the shouts of bartering
and trade are heard. The somewhat large Manarai Spaceport is to the south,
and ships can be seen taking off farther south in the distance. A
relatively well-known cheap hotel is to the northwest, with scruffy
citizens wandering in and out of it.  Traffic flows above the intersection
in great size, and the overall sense of rush and isolation from others
sets the tone of what has happened to the galaxy due to increased
population. 

A &Rred&R&W holovid sign northeast reads. "&RHarloch's Cantina&R&W."

A dirty home~
Dirty cloths are piled up immediately in front of the partially  open door.
 Empty bottles lie stacked up next to it, prohibiting  the door's free
range of movement.  What looks to have started out  as an expensive couch
bears many liquid stains and tears. An old  holo-projector stands in a
corner, flickering half-heartedly.  The main feature of the room is a
large wooden shelf with many  compartments in its base.  A bottle opener
and several small  glasses sit on top of the shelf.

The wooden shelf appears to be a once-expensive bar.  Now, scratches and
dents cover its surface, showing signs of much use and age.

The holo-projector, while on, keeps attempting to project its images, 
however, whether it be age or damage, it is unsuccessful. But it's

The aged wood of the door stands out from the durasteel plating  making up
the walls. Leading out to the busy halls of  Coruscant, it does little to
stop the noise of the crowds.

A large canopy bed and a messy wardrobe can be seen through the  door frame
seperating the two rooms.

E
expensive couch~
The cracked leather of the couch could have come from any number of 
creatures. However, from the intricate designs and colors painted  into
the piece of furniture, one can tell it was once valueable.  Now, however,
stains from an unknown liquid cover the faded, cracked  surface.

large canopy bed~
This bed was created with dark wood and fine cloth.  Completed with a large
mattress, it looks extremely expensive.  It has been set with  once-white
sheets that now are quite a bit yellowed, and muddy boots lie on the
coverall.  
~
E
wardrobe~
The fine, chiselled doors to the wardrobe stand wide open. Beyond the 
inset design of a blue-green planet, the bare walls of the empty  inside
explains the abundance of clothes on the floor of the main  room.
