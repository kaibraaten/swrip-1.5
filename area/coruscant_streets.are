A Cheap Hotel~
This old hotel looks to be relatively safe if not clean. The rates are
cheap anyways. The walls are made of a synthetic wood material and the
floor is covered in a dirty brown carpet. Behind an old fashioned desk is
an assortmant of keycards sealed behind a more modern energy shield.  

This would be a good place to rest for a while. You may quit and renter
the game from here.

A Brothel~
The brothel seems once have been the lobby of an old hotel that has since
been taken over by a less respected organization. The old furnishings that
surround the room are torn and stained the walls are chipped and peeling
in places and the carpets are extreemly dirty. Not the nicest place but
most clients don't seem to mind.

A Hallway~
This hallway is a literal assault on your senses. Your eyes are filled with
the sight of torn wallpaper, stains and small pieces of leftover wrappers.
Your nose is filled with the smells of the sweat and other bodily
secretions of 100 different species of creatures. Your ears are filled
with the sounds of banging, squeeking, grunting, moaning, screaming, and
the low hum of whispered thoughts.

An Office~
The smells and sounds of the brothel fill this office, but it all seems
more pleasant here in this nicely furnished office. A large wooden desk is
the focus of the room. It is around the walls of the room are a few
bookshelves and several filing cabinets. The chair to the desk is very
large. The room is decorated with an intersting assortment of unusual
sexual aids. Some of which you can't even begin to imagine what they could
possibly be used for.
