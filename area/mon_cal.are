The Legend of the Parchment

During the excavation for New Akatamer, a chest of weapons and artifacts
was uncovered, was concluded to have originated with an ancient mon Calamrian's

All the weapons of this group had shiny metal surfaces and had been covered
by black tar.  The conclusion was that the clan had attempted to avoid
detection in sunlight by preventing the blades of their weapons from
reflecting the sun's rays.
The created most of thier armor from raiding the quarren's mine shafts
long
before the two races became friends.

Hidden among the weapons and artifacts was a set of tattered parchments,
which upon translation, appeared to be Training material written by
ancient Quarren.  Although some of the information is now obsolete,
some of the info still be of use.

quickly regenerate a shield or spell if it wears out.  You must carry
scanners, spices and other objects that will give you force and heals and
you must be prepared to get them and use them instantly.  This means you
have to carry some in your inventory and some in containers.  You need to
have macros set up to get them and use them.  If you do not use macros,
you need to know which items are stored in which containers so you can get
them instantly.  When attacked by surprise, you cannot afford to start
fumbling around hunting for supplies -- you will likely die.   (Type look

Area Knowledge

Area Knowledge is important to survival whether engaging in pkilling or mob
killing.  You should try to learn as much about an area before attempting
to operate in it.  Know nearby safe zones and where you can or cannot
recall from.  This knowledge may save you in the future.

Dealing with Immunities

Some players and mobs are immune to different types of weapons and spells.
It's a good idea to carry a few different kinds of weapons and be prepared
to use a few different kinds of offensive spells.  It is important during a
fight to try and see if your weapons and spells are doing any damage.  If
your weapon is constantly "missing" (not dodged or parried, but missing),
be ready to switch to another weapon.  If your fireball constantly misses,
try a different kind of spell.  There are many, including lightning bolt,
burning hands, color spray, energy drain and many others to choose from.


Avoiding Death Traps and Other Nasty Surprises

When you are in an unfamiliar place, it is a good idea to look ahead before
entering a new room.  Use scry or scan to do this.  If you see a room that
has no exits, you need to be cautions because it might be a death trap.  If
you cannot scry or scan, type "look direction" and read the description of
what lies in that direction.  Most of these rooms are not death traps, they
just have exits that are not obvious or require you to recall to exit.  One
good technique is to bring a friend or a character with little equipment
and send them in to test for a death trap.  Having friends in the mud pays

dividends in many ways.
~
E
5~
Disarm

If you can disarm an opponent and take their weapon, you can get a great
advantage.  This tactic is a little over-rated because your opponent may
have a good grip on their weapon or may have extra weapons.  The effort
you put into disarming them takes away from other tactics you should be
using instead.  Disarming mobs can sometimes be a bad move because some
mobs hit much harder when disarmed.  If you must try this skill, perhaps
you should try it only once or twice in a fight and then move on.


Backstab

If you can backstab an opponent to start a fight, you should certainly try
it.  In order to be backstabbed, however, an opponent must be at full hit

points.  If they never eat or drink (a good tactic against backstabbing),
they will always be a few hp below maximum.  You can always start a fight
by healing your opponent in the hopes of bringing them to full hit points,
then backstab them.  Naughty but Nice!

The platiki metallic  sculpture is of a Calamrian in his late years
wielding a E-web Blaster against an unseen attacker, although from the

golden plaque sits near the statue, explaining its importance.  The newly

&W Walking on Law Avenue you pass a building that explains the roads name,
City Hall. It is here you goto pay tickets and fines, along with chat with

the mayor. The building which stands over 300 ft high is made of fine
polished granite imported from a nearby moon. It's extravegent

look;matches the city's over rehaul plan. The walkway leading up to the
building has polished stones buried into the ground to create a peaceful
walkway.  Plants from nearby planets are now growing along side the
walkway to make it more inviting. Unfortunately the interior is not yet
finished so you can not take a tour.

of the art Dockingbay recently recived a facelift to allow for a better
image of the planet. The floor is now a polished metal, that reflexs the
extensive lighting system they installed. From the ceiling you can see new
sprinklers to allow mon citizens to remain damp. This new facility was also
outfitted with a restarea to the east for individuals waiting for the
transport. To the North is outside the city. While to the South is the
intersection of Anna Avenue and Security Road. We hope you enjoy your stay

&z You enter the main office of the Mon Calamari Security. This room is
slightly, less extravegant then the rest, and has more of a rough ocean
bottom feel. The walls  are decorated with pictures of wanted men, and the
floors are polished rock that imitates a marble look. This rock was
inported from the depths of the ocean floor. In front of you is a large
counter to which you see alot of people working behind. At the counter is
a sign that says step up for assistance.

Coral City Park~
&G This area was once a apartment complex, but due to the recent renovation
project, the city mayor decided this would be a better idea. The ground is
covered by a imported weed from a nearby planet. It is well known for it's
durablity and groth rate. Both of which will be need to maintain the
trampling and activity it will see. This grass like surface is new to Mon
Calamarians and they find it extremely interesting, while the Quarren's
find it just frivlous.

and your currencey. There is a large table in the center of the room to
sign your life away along with, a counter towards the back where a very
attractive clerk stands and counts the daily inflow of credits. On the top
of the ceiling you can see a rather expensive security system tracking
your everymove. The First bank of Mon's motto isn't "your money is safe
with us for no reason." To make a bank transaction please type bank.
