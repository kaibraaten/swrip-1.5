tables. Each table has a set of controlls for adjusting the height of\
the table. This compartment was obviously made to accomedate some of\
the larger passengers who would find it difficult to manuever around\
other parts of the ship. There are no windows but small ceiling\
mounted viewscreens can either be tuned to the ship mounted cameras\
or to one of several galactic network channels.   A passenger\
terminal is installed on one of the walls here for you to leave\
comments to the management or leave general posts for the other\
passengers. To the south a set of large doors leads to the ships\
bathroom facilities. \
