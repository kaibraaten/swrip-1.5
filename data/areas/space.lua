stages of construction. The floor is littered with ship parts, tools,\
pipes and tubes of all sorts. Droids of all shapes and sizes\
including a couple of large cranes help the technicians with the ship\
construction. There are lift tubes rising from the floor and\
extending to the ceiling in various places. These are connected to\
larger capital ships under construction that are moored to the\
outside of the station. A shield wall extends most of the way around\
the platform containing the atmosphere and allowing the crew to work\
without space suits.\
