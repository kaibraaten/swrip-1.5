Desert~
The hard sand beneath your feet is hot and you can only see the same things
for miles to come. You are walking on the rippiling surface of the sand
which has been expoed to e treme heat over the many years. The sand is
very warm and stings your face as the wind blows it up onto your soft
skin. The air is heavy and very heavy to breathe but living with it
something you accepted when you entered the desert.

you feel twice as heavy as usual. At some points down this way it gets
steep and you slip a little landing right on your behind.

feel twice as heavy as usual. As you walk slowly down the side of the
cliff the sand gets sharper and if you are not wearing foot gear it could
get painful.

hot and sandy as most  f this planet is. But as it is a city it is
placed over a flat area. The air he e is hot and heavy and makes you
slow down, but you stride on. You can feel the warmth pounding down
on your back as you walk but for now that is not your concern. The
sand is blowing up into your face and when it hits you it feels as if
someone is there slaping you. Just keep your head down and hope your
gogles can withstand the many sand storms this planet has to deal
with.

Quarters~
Here, at night Jawas go to sleep. There are millions of tiny things
from wires  nd circuts to translator droid in here. Considering the
fact that Jawas sleep i  this room it has a quite awful stench.
Downwards there is a small opening lead ng to lower levels or
something of an interesting nature. This room is very comfortable and
safe with guard in pretty much all directions.
 
You may safely quit from here.

The Bus Stop~
You are standing on a platform where the public busses land every so

the busses are slow they are a mean of transportation. The only
reason they are slow is because they are provided to the public for
free. Thinking about this it makes it hard to maintain the busses
without enough ressources.

hot and sharp. The wind blows in your face, sometimes bringing
particles of sand into your face stinging you and sometimes getting
into your eyes. The air is very warm, heated by the twin suns of the
planet. The heat makes the air heavier and harder to breath yet you
move on. Ahead you can see a corner that curves into a store of some
kind. On the front it says "Spaceport Speeders".

wind blows it hurts more for the grains of sand hit you in larger
numbers making you ache all over. The air is hot, not as hot as the
rest of the city because the street is covered in shade, but it is
still hot. The air is also lighter and makes you relax as you walk.
