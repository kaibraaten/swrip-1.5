Zim the Failed Jedi stands here before you.

Zim is a middle-aged male human with silvery stripes in his dark brown hair.
His stomach is bulging over a leather belt that has a lightsaber hanging from
it. 

In his younger days, during the Clone Wars, he was an apprentice to a minor
Jedi Master. Unfortunately Zim never quite had the talent to pass the Jedi
trials, and when Order 66 was issued, he was somehow overlooked. Since then
he's been in hiding, seeking to pass on what little he learned.

The dunes around you are normal as you walk over the endless amount of sand.
The sea of rippling sand still surrounds you with overwhelming greatness. The
sand has a reflective shine to it assisted by the sunrays of the heating suns.
You feel enclosed because the dunes tower over you greatly.

rest of your face. To the south the sand looks very unstable. It would be

turn down any one of the number of roads and paths. The ground here is
hot and sandy as most of this planet is. But as it is a city it is
placed over a flat area. The air here is hot and heavy and makes you
slow down, but you stride on. You can feel the warmth pounding down
on your back as you walk, but for now that is not your concern. The
sand is blowing up into your face and when it hits you it feels as if
someone is there slapping you. Just keep your head down and hope your
goggles can withstand the many sand storms this planet has to deal
with.

sandy, the air hot and heavy and of course the heat continuously
pelts down on you as the twin suns heat the planet. The many business
places that are around you look interesting and some may be of use. 
There is some active life all around you and it scares you at how
many dirty people can be in one place.

Path In The City~

you can tell this for the rock is shaved away by weight and the path
is full of marks. Straight ahead also there is a huge fortress of
some sorts. It is simply constructed and seems old, but that is
probably because of the wind and the scorching suns of Tatooine.

Entrance To Jawa Fortress~
You are standing in a very large room. It was built plainly and simply
and there are no signs of art even from their own culture in this
room. There are some narrow corridors in many directions leading to
different parts of the fortress.

A Narrow Hallway~
You are walking down a small narrow hallway that is not very well
lit. The few glowpanels that are left on the ceiling are either
inoperative or malfunctioning. Further down the hallway, the hallway
come to an abrupt stop and turn off. The ground you walk on is rough
but the lack of sunlight keeps its moisture and color well.

Hallway~
You are standing on a colder harder surface than in the hot desert. It
is like this because of the lack of sunlight in this enormous
fortress. The glow panels above flicker as if running out of energy.
Directly in front of you the hallway splits off with a sharp turn
towards the south.

You walk along in a large room. The ground beneath your feet is rocky
and yet sandy at the same time making your feet feel better for the
ground is not as rough as straight rock. There is no lighting in this
room but you can still make your way around. The air is cool and crisp
making it a little easier to breathe.

Quarters~
Here, at night Jawas go to sleep. There are millions of tiny things
from wires and circuits to translator droid in here. Considering the
fact that Jawas sleep in this room it has a quite awful stench.
Downwards there is a small opening leading to lower levels or
something of an interesting nature. This room is very comfortable and
safe with guard in pretty much all directions.
 
You may safely quit from here.

goods that are probably useless to the everyday person. There is a jawa
guard half asleep here watching over the items. This room does not seem to

particles of sand into your face stinging you and sometimes getting

kind. On the front it says "Spaceport Speeders".
