\13Some players and mobs are immune to different types of weapons and spells.\
\13It's a good idea to carry a few different kinds of weapons and be prepared\
\13to use a few different kinds of offensive spells.  It is important during a\
\13fight to try and see if your weapons and spells are doing any damage.  If\
\13your weapon is constantly \"missing\" (not dodged or parried, but missing),\
\13be ready to switch to another weapon.  If your fireball constantly misses,\
\13try a different kind of spell.  There are many, including lightning bolt,\
\13burning hands, color spray, energy drain and many others to choose from.\

\13Avoiding Death Traps and Other Nasty Surprises\
\13\
\13When you are in an unfamiliar place, it is a good idea to look ahead before\
\13entering a new room.  Use scry or scan to do this.  If you see a room that\
\13has no exits, you need to be cautions because it might be a death trap.  If\
\13you cannot scry or scan, type \"look direction\" and read the description of\
\13what lies in that direction.  Most of these rooms are not death traps, they\
\13just have exits that are not obvious or require you to recall to exit.  One\
\13good technique is to bring a friend or a character with little equipment\
\13and send them in to test for a death trap.  Having friends in the mud pays\
\13\
\13dividends in many ways.\

\13\
\13If you can disarm an opponent and take their weapon, you can get a great\
\13advantage.  This tactic is a little over-rated because your opponent may\
\13have a good grip on their weapon or may have extra weapons.  The effort\
\13you put into disarming them takes away from other tactics you should be\
\13using instead.  Disarming mobs can sometimes be a bad move because some\
\13mobs hit much harder when disarmed.  If you must try this skill, perhaps\
\13you should try it only once or twice in a fight and then move on.\
\13\
\13\
\13Backstab\
\13\
\13If you can backstab an opponent to start a fight, you should certainly try\
\13it.  In order to be backstabbed, however, an opponent must be at full hit\
\13\
\13points.  If they never eat or drink (a good tactic against backstabbing),\
\13they will always be a few hp below maximum.  You can always start a fight\
\13by healing your opponent in the hopes of bringing them to full hit points,\
\13then backstab them.  Naughty but Nice!\

\13Some players and mobs are immune to different types of weapons and spells.\
\13It's a good idea to carry a few different kinds of weapons and be prepared\
\13to use a few different kinds of offensive spells.  It is important during a\
\13fight to try and see if your weapons and spells are doing any damage.  If\
\13your weapon is constantly \"missing\" (not dodged or parried, but missing),\
\13be ready to switch to another weapon.  If your fireball constantly misses,\
\13try a different kind of spell.  There are many, including lightning bolt,\
\13burning hands, color spray, energy drain and many others to choose from.\

\13Avoiding Death Traps and Other Nasty Surprises\
\13\
\13\
\13When you are in an unfamiliar place, it is a good idea to look ahead before\
\13entering a new room.  Use scry or scan to do this.  If you see a room that\
\13has no exits, you need to be cautions because it might be a death trap.  If\
\13you cannot scry or scan, type \"look direction\" and read the description of\
\13what lies in that direction.  Most of these rooms are not death traps, they\
\13just have exits that are not obvious or require you to recall to exit.  One\
\13good technique is to bring a friend or a character with little equipment\
\13and send them in to test for a death trap.  Having friends in the mud pays\
\13dividends in many ways.\

\13\
\13If you can disarm an opponent and take their weapon, you can get a great\
\13advantage.  This tactic is a little over-rated because your opponent may\
\13have a good grip on their weapon or may have extra weapons.  The effort\
\13you put into disarming them takes away from other tactics you should be\
\13using instead.  Disarming mobs can sometimes be a bad move because some\
\13mobs hit much harder when disarmed.  If you must try this skill, perhaps\
\13you should try it only once or twice in a fight and then move on.\
\13Backstab\
\13\
\13If you can backstab an opponent to start a fight, you should certainly try\
\13it.  In order to be backstabbed, however, an opponent must be at full hit\
\13points.  If they never eat or drink (a good tactic against backstabbing),\
\13they will always be a few hp below maximum.  You can always start a fight\
\13by healing your opponent in the hopes of bringing them to full hit points,\
\13then backstab them.  Naughty but Nice!\
