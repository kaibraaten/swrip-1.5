Brennik Torien~
Brennik~
Brennik, the pluogus bartender is here selling drinks.
~
Brennik Torien is not the most attractive correlien you've ever seen
but he is by no means ugly either. His apearance does however suffer
somewhat from the dark bags under his eyes that suggest long hours of
work. He is slim and agile and moves quickly and gracefully between
customers. His voice is strong and caries well across the crowded bar
room yet is comforting at the same time. You feel that many people
would find it quite easy to talk of just about anything to this man.

Coruscant Shipyard: Docking Platform Alpha~
You are on the main platform of the shipyard orbiting Coruscant. Because
it is an off planet shipyard, larger capital ships maybe built and launched
from here as well as the more standard planetary ones.
All of the ships in this part of the shipyard are ready for flight.
Many of them are owned by the rebel alliance but there are often several
private ones docked here as well as some available to rent

The large bay is open at all ends. The atmosphere and pressure is contained
by an energy field that stretches all around its perimiter. The ceiling
is high enough for lorger ships although the biggest ones dock underneath
or on the roof of the platform and are accessed through air tubes.
This part of the station is not used at all for construction. All of
the equipment here is geared towards refueling and repairing ships.

You are standing by the inside wall of platform alpha. The enormous
shipyard ahead of you is open all all sides except for this one.
The dock is filled with spacecraft of many shapes and sizes. Several
technicians can be seen refueling and making adjustments to some of the
spacecraft as well as many astromech droids wheeling in and out around
the many tubes and equipment lining the floors.
There is a small lift platform as well as stairs leading up to the catwalk
above as well as to the rest of the station.

A Turbocar~
This turbo car runs across the space station connecting platforms alpha
and gamma to the hub of the station.
The floor is covered in a dark rubber that provides good traction at the
same time as being easy to clean. There are cushioned benches along the
walls of the car although most passengers prefer to stand as the trip is
very short. Looking out the window you see the tunnel lights rush by
becoming a long blur and then coming to focus again as you reach your
destination.

A Turbocar~
This turbo car runs across the space station connecting platforms delta
and beta to the hub of the station.
The floor is covered in a dark rubber that provides good traction at the
same time as being easy to clean. There are cushioned benches along the
walls of the car although most passengers prefer to stand as the trip is
very short. Looking out the window you see the tunnel lights rush by 
becoming a long blur and then coming to focus again as you reach your
destination.

Coruscant Shipyard: Docking Platform Beta-N~
The ships in this part of the shipyard seem to in most cases be in the
state of being repaired. Some have open plates revealing electrical
ship components while others are missing doors or airfoils. One
larger ship even has an enormous hole in the side clear through to
what apears to be a passenger hold. The room is noisy with the sounds
of torches and other tools. The occasional small explosion can
sometimes be heard as well as an engine firing briefly for a few
seconds now and again.

This platform is filled with of many shapes and sizes in various
stages of construction. The floor is littered with ship parts, tools,
pipes and tubes of all sorts. Droids of all shapes and sizes
including a couple of large cranes help the technicians with the ship
construction. There are lift tubes rising from the floor and
extending to the ceiling in various places. These are connected to
larger capital ships under construction that are moored to the
outside of the station. A shield wall extends most of the way around
the platform containing the atmosphere and allowing the crew to work
without space suits.

you see mostly starfighters docked on the platform bellow but there
are also many shuttles as well as a couple of larger ships.
All of the ships here look to be space ready. You see no cranes or other
shipbuilding equipment.
There is a small lift that leads down onto the platform here. To the west
a turbocar can take you to the main part of the station.

Kuat Shipyard, Main Hangar W~
The shipyard level of the station is one enormous hangar. Hundreds of
ships are docked throughout it. Some are situated on raised
platforms while others which are under construction are in building
pits. The ceiling is high enough for ships to comfortably navigate
the shipyard. The entire shipyard deck is incredibly clean
considering the work done. The floor is a smooth polished black

the perimeter of the station. Hotel rooms  are located along these
corridors circling the entire commercial deck - tucked in behind the

courtyard, a large store and a cantina. The courtyard is a wide and very
clean. The floor here is a polished black synthetic marble and the walls
are a deep grey as they are in most of the rest of the station. However
hanging over the courtayrd is a large hanging crystal structure. It
reflects the light casting reflective light and dark spots around the area
giving the courtyard a rather pleasant look for an imperial instalation. A
large fountain is set into a lowered region in the center of the courtyard
directly bellow the chandelier structure.

The Z-95 headhunter is an older model starfighter but still used
widely throughout the galaxy. The cramped cockpit is just big enough
for one person. The canopy does open up nearly 180 degrees though,

You are in the cockpit of a standard Lambda-class shuttle. It is a

few passengers or a flight officer who might wish to oversee the
flight operation, however most of the passenger seating is towards
the back of the spacecraft.

Entrance~
The entrance ramp is located just behind the cockpit of the shuttle
and extends down underneath it when open. This almost gives the
apearance of the shuttle opening its 'mouth' to let out passengers.
The ramp is covered in a dark carpet suitable for formal apearances.
A hallway extends around the ramp heading up towards the cockpit and
back towards the passenger compartment.

Cockpit~
The assault shuttle is designed to carry stormtroopers and zero-g
stormtroopers rather than small groups of passengers. Because of this
it is designed more for combat and durability than the lambda class
shuttles. The cockpit is spacious and contains seating for 5
crewmembers including a senoir officer, two pilots, a navigator, and
a gunner.

as well as into space. The cockpit of the shuttle is to the north and
trooper bay to the south. A ladder leads up to a laser turret.

Cockpit~
You are in the cockpit of a standard Lambda-class shuttle. It is a
popular lightly armed shuttle used by the Empire for transporting
small groups of people. The cockpit is equipped with chairs for both
a pilot and a co-pilot. There is room enough behind the chairs for a
few passengers or a flight officer who might wish to oversee the flight
operation, however most of the passenger seating is towards the back of

Inside a Y-Wing's Cockpit~
You are surrounded by the antiquated instruments and control panels of
a Y-Wing snub fighter.  For the most part, the cockpit is servicable,
panel, and an instrument glowlight that doesn't work anymore.  The
well-worn flight seat is a welcome comfort though: compared to newer
ship's firm, uncomfortable ones, it has obviously been worn down to a
comfortable level by use over hundreds of flight hours. Your external
view is partially blocked by the classic durasteel reinforcement
struts lining the sides of the front plastisteel view plate.  This
flaw, which has been remedied in newer ships, is one of the main
reasons the Y-Wing never became a popular snub fighter and was often
used as a bomber instead.

Inside a Rebel Alliance B-Wing Starfighter~
The command pod of the B-wing starfighter is roomy and provides a very
comfortable ride. It is suspended by a gyroscopically stabalized
suspension system alowinng it to remain stable while the airfoil
rotates around it. The main airfoil of the ship stretches out in one
direction from the command pod. Two movable secondary airfoils cross
the main one halfway down during combat and tuck in along the length
during regular flight. Although the B-wing is one of the slower
starfighters still used it makes up in firepower and durability what
it lacks in thrust.The B-wing is one of the most durable and heavily
armed Rebel Alliance starfighters.

Inside an A-Wing Starfighter~
The cramped cockpit of this A-Wing fighter doesn't seem so
uncomfortable when you realize that the space taken away from the
pilot's area has been used to afford faster engines and stronger
shields. The instruments available to you tell that this craft's 
maximum velocity is well above many of the other ships you have
piloted. A ship this powerful it almost seems rediculous to get in
with a ladder.

Inside an Imperial TIE Fighter~
You sit in one of the now rare Sienar Technologies Twin Ion Engine
starfighters. During the height of the Emporer's reign when there was
money and pilots to throw away on cheap mass-produced starfighters
these ships built in surplus. Now they they have been almost all
replaced by the longer lasting, shielded TIE Advanced starfighters.
The cockpit is cramped with many controlls and the view window only
faces forward giving the pilot a very restricted field of view.  Even
if you could see out the sides of the cockpit however your view would
still be blocked by the two hexagonal solar-panels mounted on the
sides of TIE fighters, giving them their very unique look.

Inside A TIE Interceptor~
The TIE Interceptor was an early improvement over the original TIE
Fighter. It was faster more manueverable and had greater firepower
than its predecessor. It was still however lacking in shields and
thus dangerous to fly for the unskilled. TIE Interceptors are easy to
spot among regular TIEs due to their bent wing shape.

The Cockpit of a TIE Bomber~
Although slower and less manuevaerable than the TIE fighter it carries
quite an offensive arsonel. As they  can carry many missiles and
bombs a group of them could provide a serious threat to a capital
ship or space station. They are however pretty useless in dog fights.
The TIE Bomber is easily distinguishable from the TIE Fighters due to
its twin pods and bent / stretched solar panels.

Inside a TIE Advanced Starfighter~
The TIE Advanced starfighter is similar to the TIE Interceptor in many
aspects. It is slightly large and faster and provides more manueverbility
than the older TIE models, and allows easier customization. This
particular TIE Advanced was once modified for atmospheric combat, and
features high-sensitivity solar panels on each wing. It's apparent this
TIE Advanced has been modified greatly, with aftermarket non-standard
Imperial issue electronics and targetting capabilities.

The Cockpit of Imperial TIE Defender TF-0001~
Of the all the Sienar Systems TIE starcraft the TIE Defender is the

three sets of solar panals encircling it at equal distances from the
cockpit. Its cockpit extends forward more than the other TIE models
and provides superior visability due to the almost complete ring of
transparasteel around the top and sides of the pilot. The TIE
defender is equiped with shields, a hyperdrive, and a full array of
weaponry making it a very dangerous opponent.

The Bar~
Welcome to the hub of pluogus activity. This room seems to always be
busy. THe main bar stretches across the back wall. A humaniod bar
keeper moves quickly from customer to customer with the efficiency
that only comes with years of experience. Behind him are shelves of
bottles in every conceivable shape color and size. Enough to keep
anyone busy for a very long voyage. The front of the bar is devoid of
chairs. But the rest of the room is quite full of them. In fact, the
ship designers seem to have given up the wide hallway aproach seen in
the rest of the vessle in favor of trying to cram in as many booths
as possible into this part of the ship.   Because of this a smaller
bar is installed next to the door offering a minimal selection of
drinks for those who don't wish to fight their way to the back.

tables. Each table has a set of controlls for adjusting the height of
the table. This compartment was obviously made to accomedate some of
the larger passengers who would find it difficult to manuever around
other parts of the ship. There are no windows but small ceiling
mounted viewscreens can either be tuned to the ship mounted cameras
or to one of several galactic network channels.   A passenger
terminal is installed on one of the walls here for you to leave
comments to the management or leave general posts for the other
passengers. To the south a set of large doors leads to the ships
bathroom facilities.

The Rest Room~
You notice a strong antiseptic smell as you walk into this room. The
floor is smooth and has been recently cleaned and polished.  Th wall
opposite the entrance is furnished with several stalls of various
shapes and sizes. Each of them is an attempt to provide a comfortable
toilet for each of the more common travelling galactic races. Looking
from stall to stall you might find it amusing to see what some
species call toilets. On the door side of the room stretches a large
counter top from wall to wall. It is fitted with several sinks, spray
hoses and other disinfectant and deionizing devices. At the farthest
end of the room between the stalls and sinks are two large waste
disposal units. One is an incineration device for solids and the
other a disposable tank for combustable liquids such as the grease
used by some older model droids.

low tables. The furniture all apears quite comfortable and obviously
are designed for humaniod forms. The lighting is relatively dim but
directional lights by each table can be brightened to suit each
passengers tastes. To the north a gimps of the stars can be seen
through the observation lounge. To the south is the sleeping
compartments. A turbolift leads down to the main deck.

The Sleeping Compartment~
You are in the bed chambers of the public tour bus the Serin Pluogus.
In an attempt to promote galactic trade and tourism, several large
corperations and planets teamed together to fund this completely free
tour bus. This room was a late add on to the Pluogus for those
passengers wishing for private sleeping quarters on long tours. The
large room   is sectioned off into enclosed bunks stacked along the
walls. There are several different sized chambers but most of them
seem designed to fit one or two humans comfortably. All the beds have
a somewhat soundproof door and are lockable from the inside.     
 
This would be a good place to rest for awhile. You may safely
leave and re-enter the game from here.

Sorosuub System Hopper~
The sorosuub system hopper is a small shuttle designed for short voyages.
It is equiped with a hyperdrive but long journeys could get tiresome in
such a confined space. The hoppers only defence is some weak shielding
suitable for protection against small bits of debris but pretty much
useless in combat.

B-Wing Starfighter bw08~
The command pod of the B-wing starfighter is roomy and provides a very
comfortable ride. It is suspended by a gyroscopically stabalized
suspension system alowinng it to remain stable while the airfoil
rotates around it. The main airfoil of the ship stretches out in one
direction from the command pod. Two movable secondary airfoils cross
the main one halfway down during combat and tuck in along the length
during regular flight. Although the B-wing is one of the slower
starfighters still used it makes up in firepower and durability what
it lacks in thrust.The B-wing is one of the most durable and heavily
armed Rebel Alliance starfighters.

Rogue One Cockpit~
The snub fighter or X-wing is the main fighter utilised by the Rebel
Alliance. This particular model bears the insignia of &RRogue Squadron&w.
The main recognizable feature of the Z-wing is the wing assembly, which
split apart during combat to give the best firing configuration. The
Wings flatten during hyperspace creating a more streamlined form.

the accessible engine parts are concealed behind removable pannels.
There is a large computer terminal on one wall with many controls and

couple of standard interface sockets for droids. This room is
extreemly noisy being right beside the engine which seems to rattle

Passenger Lounge~
The passenger lounge was designed to be quite comfortable for human
passengers. A dark rich carpet covers the entire floor. The chairs
flank small tables that are spread along the walls of the
compartment. Adjustable glow panels are strategicly positioned by
each table providing directional light for reading and working or a
more difused light for social rides.

Shuttle Cockpit~
You are in the cockpit of a standard Lambda-class shuttle. It is a
popular lightly armed shuttle used by the Empire for transporting
small groups of people. The cockpit is equipped with chairs for both
a pilot and a co-pilot. There is room enough behind the chairs for a
few passengers or a flight officer who might wish to oversee the flight
operation, however most of the passenger seating is towards the back of
the spacecraft.

An Airlock~
It is not a very wise thing to play in the airlock. A button on the wall is
used to decompress the airlock. If you push it it will most likely kill
you instantly. It would be best to leave and exit the ship in a more
traditional way like using the exit ramp.

Oops....~
Looking at the planet around you it apears ... well ... er ...
unfinished. Looks like some of the Omipresent beings that are in
charge of such things have been slacking off...
 
Going down will take you to a slightly more playable planet ( even if
not entirely finished itself ;)

the pluogus route.

Passenger Lounge~
The main loung of the Serin Tocca is very similar to the pluogus even
though the ships are quite different. The large central hallway is flanked
by couches and chairs of various dimensions in an attempt to accomodate
passengers of all shapes and sizes. Some are even designed to be
adjustable although only manually. There apears to be no automatic
form-chairs at least in this room.

The Gift Shop~
This large room is a smorgasboard of displays. Most of them seem to contain
useless junk but a few items might be usefull to you. A small cash counter
is in one corner of the room but it is rarely used as a retail service
droid handles most transactions directly. There are several vending
machines along one wall offering many different varieties of packaged food
and drink.  There are however only a couple of tables in this part of ship
to sit down and eat.

Sleeping Compartment~
This large room   is sectioned off into enclosed bunks stacked along the
walls. There are several different sized chambers but most of them seem
designed to fit one or two humans comfortably. All the beds have get ammo
back ammo somewhat soundproof door and are lockable from the inside.     
This would be a good place to rest for awhile. You may safely leave and
re-enter the game from here.

Tocca Restaurant and Pub~
This large sectoin near the fron of the ship has many tables and chairs of
various sizes. The lighting is dim and soft string music fills the room.
However, it is hard to hear of the noise of the ship and the chatter of
the room.

Entrance to the Cassia~
You stand on the entrance ramp of the Serin Cassia. There are seats here so
that you and the rest of the passengers do not have to stand for what may
be a long trip. The Serin Cassia is equipped with facilities that make the
ride more comfortable for all the galactic citizens that board her. The
rest of the ship lies to the north and south of you.

He has an assortment of cocktails on his shelves. The bar is made of wood
from the worshyr tree of Kashyyyk. The tree is extremely tall, which makes
it very suitable for a bar. Most of the over-aged passengers aboard the
Cassia come here to have a drink and speak of their destinations.

Siego Entrance~
One of the buses that transport people around the galaxies, the Serin Siego
is a bare bones ship. It has little in terms of comfort and its entrance
reflects this.  The walls are bare and weldings can easily be seen. Since
it is publicly funded, it is not as stable as those privately owned.  
Ride at your own risk!
