N, E, W, S, NE, NW, SE, SW, U, or D. There are also SOMEWHERE exits that\

When you die you loose everything. However... somewhere deep in the core\
worlds is a place that creates and stores the clones of those who are\
willing to pay a small fee. Having a clone makes a back up of your\
character at the moment of cloning that can be used in the event of an\
untimely death. My advice is to find the cloning facilities as soon as\
possible and make a new clone at least every five levels. Death is a lot\
less painful when you loose 5 levels as opposed to having to start over\
from the beginning.   To exit, open the door north of you by using the\
command open north. This can be used any place doors are located. Simply\
use 'open' and then the direction. \
