\13shop boss. This becomes rather tricky, since most Quarren work them, and\
\13it takes a little extra to sweaten the secretary to let you in to see the\
\13boss .  Once you enter the mine you can check out a shovel or pick (your\
\13preference) and a ore carrier (if one is available) and go to work.\
\13Digging random works the best. When you have finished a jobs work stop by\
\13the cargo haul and get paid. Payment is based on amount dug.   You are\
\13free to stop and work at anytime, just understand the ore dealer is only\
\13there for four hours.\
