\13lodes were about a foot wide. Shallow pits were dug to prove the locations\
\13of the lodes. Once found, adits were driven into the hillside following\
\13the lode. The ore is very soft and the miners would first rake out all the\
\13material in sight from the lode above them, generally for two metres or so\
\13- a method known as `hulking'. We prefer to use our ore carriers to carry\
\13most of the ore as it allows us to enter further into the mine.\
