ions cannons have been replaced with 2 concussion missile launchers.  It \
has plenty of space for the merchant family, but can not hold much cargo. \
The Preybird class starfighter is a small, fast fighter, not heavily armed,\
but its two laser cannons serve their purpose: harrying an attacker while \
the shuttle it protects escapes. The Skypray Blastboat is the family's \
secondary transport. Not large enough for luxury, it is used by a single \
member, or two at the most, on a possibly dangerous trip. The Blastboat's \
extra armament serves well to protect the occupants. \
The R-41 starchaser carries two laser cannons, but its two ion cannons have\
been removed in favor of more power to its sublight drive.  The augmented \
speed is proven to give the Head his rush when he needs to get away from \
his business.&R&W\

starfighters instead of the heavy engines it had before the modifications.\
The Head has chosen to carry Four brand new TIE Interceptors, right off \

carrying its two engines and 2 laser cannons. There is also a concussion \
missile launcher mounted to surprise anyone approaching from the rear.&R&W\
