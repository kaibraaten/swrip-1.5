of two laser turrets. It still carries its 4 laser cannons, but two of 4 \

the shuttle it protects escapes. The Skypray Blastboat is the family's \
secondary transport. Not large enough for luxury, it is used by a single \
member, or two at the most, on a possibly dangerous trip. The Blastboat's \
extra armament serves well to protect the occupants. \

been removed in favor of more power to its sublight drive.  The augmented \
speed is proven to give the Head his rush when he needs to get away from \
his business.&R&W\
