outside holds its business fleet.  The family transport is a heavily\
modified Silviut Vibre-Class shuttle.  As escorts, it has 4 Sorosuub\
Preybird-class starfighters.  A Skipray Blastboat stands near one wall,\
and the merchant Head's personal toy, a R-41 Starchaser, sits near the\
hangar door.\
 \
&CThe vibre-class shuttle has lost its 2 tractor beam projectors in favor \
of two laser turrets. It still carries its 4 laser cannons, but two of 4 \
ions cannons have been replaced with 2 concussion missile launchers.  It \
has plenty of space for the merchant family, but can not hold much cargo. \
The Preybird class starfighter is a small, fast fighter, not heavily armed,\
but its two laser cannons serve their purpose: harrying an attacker while \
the shuttle it protects escapes. The Skypray Blastboat is the family's \
secondary transport. Not large enough for luxury, it is used by a single \
member, or two at the most, on a possibly dangerous trip. The Blastboat's \
extra armament serves well to protect the occupants. \
The R-41 starchaser carries two laser cannons, but its two ion cannons have\
been removed in favor of more power to its sublight drive.  The augmented \
speed is proven to give the Head his rush when he needs to get away from \
his business.&R&W\
