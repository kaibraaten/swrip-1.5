&W\
A rather dark room is before you, and looks like it hasn't been tended to\
ages. It appears that this room has no sense of time, where a calendar\
of 2015 is on the wall, and elsewhere clocks feature differing times.\
\
Your movements seem slower here, almost becoming blurred. A desk of some\
unknown metal substance is here, yet it appears it's not made of\
metal. A futuristic sound system is on the desk as well, with speakers\
almost as large as the room.\
\
One side of this four cornered room is near-almost completely bare except a\
stand that has a custom made four-string Sadowsky bass.\
\
The expensive lighting hits the bass guitar from all directions, giving a\
sense of life to the room. As the lights hit the object, a holy sound emits\
from an unknown location and your mind becomes unstable.\
\
You become entranced in the bass guitar, and then..\
&xEverything fades to black.&w\
