wood paneled-half marble walls sits the Formal Hall and Throne Chamber,\
used when the Emperor visits.  The hallway is decorated with wood panels\
over the marble walls in places and carpet on the floor to lessen the\
echoes from the meeting rooms so that no unsuspecting ear can listen in on\
the conversations being conducted here.\
