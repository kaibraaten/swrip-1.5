other buildings, casting large shadows over the street. Natural\
illumination is impossible due to the numerous amount of buildings which\
block the sunlight; lamp posts are installed on every corner and emit a\
natural white light which runs all day, every day, without failure.  A\
marketplace is to the southeast and southwest, and the shouts of bartering\
and trade are heard. The somewhat large Manarai Spaceport is to the south,\
and ships can be seen taking off farther south in the distance. A\
relatively well-known cheap hotel is to the northwest, with scruffy\
citizens wandering in and out of it.  Traffic flows above the intersection\
in great size, and the overall sense of rush and isolation from others\
sets the tone of what has happened to the galaxy due to increased\
population. \
