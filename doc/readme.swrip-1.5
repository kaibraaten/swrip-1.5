SWRiP 1.5 modifications by Kai Braaten.

SWRiP 1.5 is a cleaned up and extensively refactored version of
Star Wars: Rise in Power 1.0.1. Due to how much the code has been reorganized,
and functions and variables has been renamed, it's not very compatible with
existing snippets, but that was never a goal in the first place.

Most of the changes done to this codebase are under the hood, and thus
invisible to players and even immortals. Then there are some changes that
alters message output somewhat, but not the actual functionality (for instance
the new generic crafting engine). Finally, there are some things that alters
gameplay, but these are usually configurable with CSET so that you can choose
the original behaviour if you prefer (for instance permadeath, the ability to
choose jedi on chargen, and others). Often the original behaviour is default,
and the new one is opt-in.
