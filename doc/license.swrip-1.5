All conditions from from the following files still apply:

* license.diku
* license.merc
* license.smaug
* license.SWReality
* license.SWRiP

If you're not into studying all the licenses, the overall theme is that you
can't make money off the code, including but not limited to selling the code
itself, or charging money to pay. It's a general consensus in the mudding
community that the Diku license permits donations to cover server costs,
although some people believe this is prohibited as well. Furthermore, you
may not remove credits, including the credits in the login sequence and
the CREDITS help file, plus some other help files as specified in the various
licenses.

In addition, all written from scratch by me is subject to the MIT license,
which is reproduced below. Basically it states that you can do whatever you want
with my code, including selling it, but you can't take credit for it. Since it
can be difficult to distinguish between code that I've written from scratch and
code derived from existing code, you can assume that all code in the
src/libs directory is subject to the MIT license unless it says otherwise
in the source file in question.
