# Old Architecture

This directory contains a mock implementation of the game.
It it written in Python. The goal is to get a thorough overview
of the current architecture. Therefore there will be very
little actual implementation. But the code should be runnable
so that it is, in effect, a high-level Python version of the
mud.

Why have I done this? Because it's imperative for the future
success of the project that the architecture is significantly
improved. When complete, I will then start refactoring it into
something better. The idea is that this process will help me
arrive at a good architecture in a relatively short time. All
current dependencies (ie the spaghetti/shanty-town design) must
be included so that I don't get any nasty surprises when I
apply this to the actual mud code.
