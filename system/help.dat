&C                       MOVING THROUGHOUT GAME:
&W                     ---------------------------
&cThe game divided into many rooms which are connected by various 
directionals to make up areas.  When you are in a room, you can 
find the exits in the room by typing &YEXITS&c.  Autoexit is a helpful 
command to initiate (type &YCONFIG +AUTOEXIT&c), because it will 
automatically show you what exits there are in the room.  Be warned 
however, you will only see the obvious exits.  You must pay attention 
to the room descriptions to see if there might be any doors or hidden 
passages in the room. 
 
&CDirectional commands: &c(in parentheses you find the shorthand)
&YNORTH (n)    SOUTH (s)    EAST (e)    WEST (w)     UP (u)     DOWN (d)
NORTHEAST (Ne)  NORTHWEST (Nw)  SOUTHEAST (Se)  SOUTHWEST (Sw)

       refers to your movement points.  If your movement points were 
       to run out, you will be unable to move between rooms due to 
       exhaustion.  If you type &YSLEEP&c or &YREST&c your movement points
       will slowly be replenished.  You must type &YSTAND&c or &YWAKE&c

101 AASSIGN~
Syntax: aassign <filename>.are  Example:  aassign edo.are
 
AASSIGN temporarily assigns all rooms, objects, and mobiles in the area
range to your pfile.  This allows you to use rlist, olist, mlist, and
reset list.  This also means that typing savearea, reset area, or 
instazone will affect this area.  
 
To save changes permenantly, type "aassign none" and foldarea.
 
Warning!! Do not have an area aassigned to yourself when getting personal
vnums assigned to you.  The personal vnums will overwrite the area file.
 
In order to assign a proto area to yourself, you must either have that
area bestowed to you or you must be Greater God+.
 
In order to assign a nonproto area to yourself, you must either have
that area bestowed to you by a member of the Area Council or you must
be Exalted+. Even if you have the area bestowed to you, only Lesser+
can assign themselves nonproto areas.

&CInhabitants &W:&W Adarian
&c
     This planet is the homeworld of the Adarian race. It is covered 
with volcanic mountains, most of which are perpetually covered with 
snow. Its year lasts 409 standard days. 
~

0 ADARIAN ADARIANS~
&COrigin: &YAdari 
 
&c     An alien race native to the planet Adari, the Adarians are humanoids
with unusual cranial structures.  Their skulls are elongated and tall, and
have a large hole which goes completely through it.  They have no ears or
noses, and their mouth is ringed with sharp, bony ridges instead of lips.
Adarians make up to the lack of ears with a covering of fine hairs alon 
their skulls that pick up vibration of sound waves.  A series of glands 
near the skin's surface allows them to smell.  Their throats can be 
distended and filled with air, and the resulting "long call" can be useful
as a communication method or a kind of defensive action.  The Adarians 
have a rigid caste system which dominates their society, and they have 
evolved an advanced technology based on the use of super-colled carbon-ice
computers.  They were able to remain neutral during the Galactic Civil War
by signing a non-aggression treaty with the Empire, providing the Empire 
with unlimited raw materials in return for their neutrality.

105 ADDRESIDENT REMRESIDENT~
Syntax: addresident <player>
Syntax: remresident <player>

Addresident and remresident add and remove residents from a particular
home. When adding or removing a resident, both the resident and the home
owner must be in the home, where the home owner types addresident or
remresident followed by the name of the player to be added or removed as a
resident. Therefore, to add a resident to a home, the home owner must
first invite the player to enter (see help invite). Residents may enter
and invite others to enter the home, just as may the owner. However,
residents cannot add or remove other residents, nor can they sell the
home. Residents are not charged by the game and as such, any negotiations
for payment must be made between the resident and the home owner.

101 ADVANCE~
Syntax: advance <character> <level>

ADVANCE sets a character's level to the specified value.  It is the
only way to create new immortal characters within the game.  ADVANCE
may also be used to demote characters.
~

101 ADVANCEDEXITS~
SMAUG supports having more than one exit in the same direction,
as well as the special direction 'somewhere', represented by a '?'.
 
If you already have an exit leading north, and would like another one,
use a plus sign '+' in front of the direction:
redit exit +n 3001          - Adds another exit north to room 3001
 
To modify an extra exit like this, or to remove it, you'll have to
refer to it by number:
redit exit #2 3002          - Change the second exit to go to room 3002
 
To know what number an exit is, do an "rstat".
 
For someone to be able to use the second north exit, you have to set one
of the extra flags (see EXFLAGS) like CAN_CLIMB.  It is also usually a good
idea to set the HIDDEN flag for any special exit so that it looks nicer
with autoexits on.
 
The AUTO flag makes it possible to go in a direction by simply typing the
keyword for that exit:
redit exit ? 3001           - Create a 'somewhere' exit to 3001
redit exflags ? auto hidden - Set the proper flags
redit exname ? swim         - Set the keyword "swim"
If a player types 'swim' in the room, they will move to room 3001.

-1 ADVENTURE~
.
   In our efforts to give credit to everyone who deserves it, we almost
   forgot to give credit to one of the "grandfathers" of computer adventure
   games... David Platt, the author of the original "Adventure" (c)1979.

   Also credit to Ken Wellsch for porting the original Fortran-77 version
   to UNIX-C (over a period of about 3 years) (c)1984.

1 ADVERTIZING RULE_1~
&c
Do not advertise another mud on ANY channel.  Doing so will get you 
site-banned. This means giving out a name or site to another mud to 
attract players there. It is considered rude in all circles.  I will 
personally go to any MUD that is advertised And talk to the immortals
there.  People have been banned on THEIR mud for doing so. 
 
Also, I will ban any player found to be advertising on another MUD about
this one if it is illegal on said mud, and if an immortal complains to me
about the advertizing.

1 AF'EL~
&CSystem &W:&Y Ka'Dedus
&CInhabitants &W:&W Defel
&c
     Homeworld of the Defel race, it is a large, high-gravity world 
orbitting the ultraviolet supergiant Ka'Dedus. The planet has a thick 
atmosphere but no ozone layer, and so unltraviolet light passes 
directly to the surface. Heavy atmospheric gases then block most of the 
remaining wavelengths of light. For these reasons, all lifeforms on the 
planet have evolved with the ability to see in ultraviolet light. The 
planet's main export is the metal meleenium. At one time, Kuat Drive 
Yards mined Af'El for many of its natural minerals.

0 AFFECTED 'AFFECTED BY'~
&CSyntax:  &Yaffected       &c(abbrevation:  &Yaf&c)
&CSyntax:  &Yaffected by    &c(abbreviation: &Yaf by&c)
 
'Affected' is a powers-at-a-glance function, which displays only the powers
(and skill affects) your character is currently under.  Each affect will be
listed by name only for the sake of brevity (if you want to know what each
is doing, use help <power/skill name> or 'score'). 
 
Characters level 20 or above and deadly characters will also see the number
of rounds remaining for each affect.  Affects with a remaining lifespan of
less than 25 rounds are displayed in white, and those in immediate danger
of wearing off will flash. 
 
'Affected by' displays a character's affects separate from its power/skill
affect list.  This is useful for ensuring that affects given from equipment
are actually functioning.  For example, if you are wearing a visor with 
detect_invis but 'affected by' does not show you as having that affect, you
are not detecting invisibility. 
 
'Affected by' also displays your current susceptibilities, resistances and
immunities if your character is level 20 or higher. 
~

101 AFFECTEDBY AFFECTED_BY~
The following are affect flags that can be used when osetting an item
(with oset <item> affect affected <affect flag>).  These flags can also
be used when msetting a mobile (mset <mob name> affected <affect flag>).
They may additionally be used to mset players if your level allows it.

1 ALDERAAN~
&CSystem &W:&Y Alderaan
&CInhabitants &W:&W Human, Thranta
&c
this planet's human inhabitants were among the most peaceful beings in 
the galaxy. They were in continually harmony with the world around 
them, and chose to build their cities on top of sandstone bluffs and on 
stilts in the shallow seas. Their towering cities were built this way 
so that they wouldn't trample the grass or destroy the seas. The 
inhabitants of the planet catalogued over 8,000 species of grasses on 
the plains, and more than that in species of flowers. At the age of 
seventeen, an Alderaanian was considered and adult. It was a well-known 
custom that the adult members of Alderaans society never cut their 
hair, but allowed it to grow into long tresses. Alderaan was a staunch 
supporter of the Old Republic, and many of its inhabitants served in 
the armed forces. Following the Clone Wars and the widespread 
destruction caused by it, the government of Alderaan outlawed all 
weapons. They placed all weapons aboard a transport ship and sent the 
ship out on a never-ending series of random hyperspace jumps. The 
homeworld of the Organa family, Alderaan's role in galactici politics 
took a detour during the later years of the Old Republic. As Palpatine
continued to gain power, the Organas began organizing a resistance to
his Presidency. With the implementation of the New Order, Alderaan 
became one of the primary supporters of the newly-formed Alliance to
Restore the Republic. However, the outspoken dissatisfaction with 
Palpatine's rule led to the destruction of the planet. When Leia Organa
was captured aboard the Tantive IV over Tatooine, she was taken to 
Grand Moff Tarkin for questioning. Tarkin tried to obtain information 
from her, but she proved too strong. Even when Tarkin threatened to 
destroy Alderaan with the new Death Star, Leia lied to him about the 
location of the Alliance's base. Tarkin took no chances, however, and 
ordered the destruction of the planet. Alderaan was blown to pieces 
just before the Battle of Yavin, and all life on the planet was 
destroyed. Some 60,000 natives survived because they were off-world at
the time, and were granted a unique status within the Alliance, as well
as the New Republic

&CSyntax: &Yalias &w<&Yshortcut&w> <&Ycommand&w>
&CSyntax: &Yalias &w<&Yshortcut&w>
&c 
The &YALIAS&c command allows you to set shortcuts for commands or long 
strings of text. These can be quite useful for shortening routinely 
entered commands. Example: &Yalias heal cast heal darrik&c 
This assigns the command &Ycast heal darrik&c to the alias &Yheal&c 
so that typing in &Yheal&c will issue the full command. 
You can create up to 30 aliases. 
 
Typing &YALIAS&c with no arguments will list your current aliases. 
Your aliases will save with your character upon leaving the game. 
An alias may only contain a shortcut for a single command. If more 
sophisticated aliases are needed, a mud client package would probably 
serve the purpose better. 
 
To remove an alias, type &Yalias&c followed by the shortcut you 
wish to remove.

101 ALLOW BAN~
Syntax:  allow <site>
Syntax:  ban   <site>
Syntax:  ban
Syntax:  ban <# of ban on ban list> level <level of char to ban and below>
 
BAN <site> prohibits players from that site from logging in.
 
BAN with no arguments returns an enumerated list of banned sites.
 
To set a specific level of character to ban from a site, use 'ban' to get
the list number of the banned site and then use 'ban level'.
Example:  ban 2 level 10
 
This will ban all characters level 10 and under from the second site on
the 'ban' list.
 
ALLOW <site> removes a site from the ban list.
 
The site ban test works by suffix comparison, so if you ban 'foo.edu',
all sites within 'foo.edu' are banned as well.

the best the Empire or the Old Republic could create. As a race, 
Bothans took great pride in their clans, and it was documented that 
there were 608 registered clans on the Bothan Council. They joined the 
Alliance shortly after the Battle of Yavin. While the Bothans generally 
stayed out of the main fighting, there were two instances of Bothan 
exploits. The first came when they were leaked the information about 
the plans and data on the construction of the second Death Star near 
Endor. A number of Bothans assisted a shorthanded Rogue Squadron in 
recovering the plans from the Suprosa, but their lack of piloting 
skills got many of them killed. The plans were recovered and brought to 
Kothlis, where more Bothans were killed in an Imperial raid to recover 
the plans. Again, the Bothans retained possession of the plans, and 
eventually turned them over to Mon Mothma and the Alliance. The second 
came when they helped eliminate Imperial ships near New Cov. It was 
later revealed that the Bothans were also involved in bringing down the 
planetary shields of the planet Caamas, during the early reign of 
Emperor Palpatine, allowing the Empire to burn the surface of the 
planet to charred embers. Although the Bothans searched for several 
years to discover the clans invovled, Imperial records were too well-
guarded to provide any clues. Then, some fifteen years after the Battle 
of Endor, records were discovered at Mount Tantiss that told of the 
Bothan involvement.

&CInhabitants &W:&W (Unknown)
&c
A planet located in the Deep Core that is incredibly strong with the 
Dark Side of The Force. Originally used as a private retreat for the 
Emperor Palpatine, it was touted as a paradise. Much of its surface was
covered with tranquil lakes, and it was lit with an unusual blue-green
sunlight. Thus, Palpatine was able to get millions of people to 
voluntarily bring their life energies to the planet. Once they were 
there, Palpatine enslaved them by using the Dark Side of the Force, 
feeding the growing evil that existed on the planet. He then built it 
into a model of a society that was ruled by the Dark Side. The reborn 
Emperor used the planet as his stronghold for his cloning activities, 
and for the source of his power during his resurrection. It had a 
normal day of 31 standard hours, and a year which lasts 207 local days.

&c
     An ocean-covered world with little solid land mass, Calamari is
home to two amphibious races: the land-dwelling Mon Calamari and the
ocean-dwelling Quarren. It is a tectonically stable world, without 
mountains. The planet is covered with deep oceans, with many islands
and coral atolls. Much of the exposed land is marshy, and incapable of
supporting any kind of civilization. Thus, the two native species 
turned to building floating cities from the ores mined from the ocean
floor. Some parts of the cities are exposed above the ocean's surface,
but the majority of the space in Calamari cities is underwater. It is
famous for its shipyards. It has a single moon. Its day lasts about 21
standard hours, and its year spans 398 local days.

0 CAST FEEL~
&CSyntax &W:&Y feel <force power> <target>
&c
Before you can use a force power, you have to practice it.  The more you
practice, the higher chance you have of success.  You also must also 
be force sensitive and have enough force energy to use the powers. 
 
The <target> is optional.  Many powers which need targets will use an 
appropriate default target, especially during combat. 
 
If the power name is more than one word, then you must quote the power name
Example: feel 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word
powers.  You can abbreviate the power name.
 
When you use an offensive power, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the power is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.

1 CHANGES~
&c
New Space System is in! Help NEWSPACE for answers on the changes and how to
fly!. 
 
Chaos has a purse option, for quests and such. 
 
Ships will no longer refuel when taking off from midships and cap ships.
You will need to use the fuel command fromthe hanger.
 
Ships has been changed. It will only show t hose ships you have access to.
 
I have added two new wearlocs, over and floating.  Over can be used 
with makearmor... closing a piece you have in your over wearloc will 
keep others from seeing what you have worn under it. Floating objects
are only found in the game. There are only two, currently. However, 
floating containers do not affect your weight. 

Economy is being 'tweaked' to work properly.  Hail, quit, and launch
have been modified to cost, or cost more, credits.  Those credits 
will be output through selling items, delivering packages and repoping
mobs with credits, as it should. I will continue tweaking it until I 
have it working properly, and realistically. 

The Serins have been completely revamped. each has its own route. Use the
findserin command to see them.

Ship AI is smarter. Don't underestimate them. 

I have completed coding the basic modules, the ones governing ship stats. 
Although I have built the items themselves for Z-100s, I still have far to
go, and can not work fast on them.  I was going to have the help of a
builder on the matter, but alas, Zilbringi appears to have disappeared. 
Such is life. 
 
drag <person> out will work, now, for dragging people out of ships. 
Oh, shove <person> in <ship and shove <person> out will work too :P

1 'CLAN CREATION'~
&CClan Creation:
&c
A clan will start out as an rp clan.  It wont exist in the clan list, but
it exists in roleplay.  After a few weeks, if the clan is growing and has
achieved a good amount of members, that clan may be added as a coded clan,
with ships, funds, and a clan channel. An immortal does not have to be 
consulted to start a rp clan, although if an administrator has a problem 
with it, he or she may ask you to disband. 
~

0 CLANTALK~
&CSyntax &W:&Y clantalk <message>
&c
Provided that you are in a clan, clantalk will send the message to all
current members, as well as the deity.

0 CLASS CLASSES~
&cThe old classes have been removed in favor of an ability system that lets
you advance in several areas at once.   These ability classes are as
follows:
 
&CCombat         &PHelp Class_Combat
&CPiloting       &PHelp Piloting
&CEngineering    &PHelp Engineer
&CBounty Hunters &PHelp BH
&CSmuggling      &PHelp Smuggler
&CDiplomacy      &PHelp Diplomat
&CLeadership     &PHelp Leader
&CCommando       &PHelp Commandos
~

0 CLASS_BH~
Bounty hunters are the most feared people in the galaxy, next to forcers.
Although bounty hunters can not roll force, their ability more than makes
up for it. Backstab and circle provide an attacking ability to quickly
take most of your marks. Because of this extreme power, only hunters in
the guild can practice their skills, and the leader is very strict about
inducting people into the guild. The hunters guild is not for the newbie.
~

0 CLASS_COMBAT~
&cCombat gives you many fighting abilities. It is ideal for someone who
just wishes to act the grunt, as a imperial stormtrooper, a rebel ground
trooper, or even a black sun basher. With abilities varying from wielding
two weapons to a third attack to a 'hitall' ability to going 'berserk' to
demolitions, it can be a fun class. Most combat specialists also get high
leadership levels.

&RAlso type&W:&Y showstat combat
~

0 CLASS_DIPLOMAT~
Diplomat's also tend to have high leadership levels as well. Diplomat's can
'mass_propeganda', which will raise or lower popular support on a planet.
'Seduce' will force a person or mob to follow you.   There are not many
diplomatic skills, but most get all the leadership skills as well.
~

105 CLASS_ENGINEER~
Engineering is one of the more profitable classes. The ability to make
anything from a comlink to armor to a blaster makes you popular with a lot
of people, because a master engineer provides better goods than anything
ound in the shops of the game. One of the downsides of engineering is it
takes a lot of time, and it is not very active sitting in a workshop
making item after item. But hey, no pain, no gain!
~

0 CLASS_LEADER~
Leadership main's get a few interesting abilities. Not only can they post
guards, but they can post *elite* guards, as well as call special
forces... a more powerful form of reinforcements.  They also get dominate,
which will make a mob your slave, and torture, which will permanently
remove hitpoints from a person or a mob.  A new skill,
gather_intelligence, will gather information on an individual in the
game... anything from where he/she/it is at that moment, to what clan it
is in.
~

0 CLASS_PILOTING~
Piloting is one of the more popular classes. One of the more fun features
of the Star Wars Reality codebase is its space system, and especially its
space combat. The piloting class gives you not only the best space combat
abilities,  but also the ability to fly the most powerful ships in the
game, the capital-class ships, from the SSD Executor to the MC80 Cruiser
to one of the faction clans custom ships.
~

0 CLASS_SMUGGLER~
The smuggler has many abilities other classes can not get. The ability to
pick doors, and even ship hatches, is combined with the ability to hijack
other people's ships. This, coupled with the ability to hide from and
sneak by other players, makes the smuggler a popular choice.
~

1 'CLIMB'~
&CSyntax &R&W: &YClimb &R&W<&YDirection&R&W>
 
&cThis skill enables you to climb into and out of rooms that have no floors
or require it. 
~

1 CLONES CLONE CLONING~
&CSyntax &R&W: &Yclone
&cCloning is a vital part of your existance.  Since death is permanent, the
only way to continue a character is to have a clone.
 
&RNote: &WClones start at the last point you cloned,
      not the point you died.
 
&RNote: &WAs of March 2nd, clones have no memory
      of their past lives.
~

101 CMDTABLE~
Syntax: cmdtable

Lists all of the commands in the game, and how many times they have been used
since the last startup.
~

102 CMENU~
Syntax:  cmenu
 
Invokes an online menu to ease entering 'cset' arguments.  May not be
fully functional at this time.
~

102 CODETEST~
void do_openbay( CHAR_DATA *ch, char *argument )
{ 
  SHIP_DATA *ship;
   if (  (ship = ship_from_pilotseat(ch->in_room->vnum))  == NULL )
   {
        send_to_char("&RYou aren't in the pilots chair!\n\r",ch);
        return;
   }
   if (ship->bayopen == TRUE)
   {
      echo_to_cockpit( AT_YELLOW , ship, "Bay doors are already open!");   
    
      return;
   }
   act( AT_PLAIN, "$n flips a switch on the control panel.", ch,
         NULL, argument , TO_ROOM );
      ship->bayopen = TRUE;
      echo_to_cockpit( AT_YELLOW , ship, "Bay Doors Open");
   }
}
~

1 CODE_AVOIDING CODE_AVOIDANCE RULE_10~
&c
Using loops or bugs in the code to avoid a restriction is illegal.  This
Includes, for example, resigning from a clan in order to bypass code 
restrictions of members in that clan. &R&w
~

101 COINDUCT COOUTCAST~
'Syntax:  coinduct  <player>
Syntax:  cooutcast <player>
 
Coinduct and cooutcast are similar to the 'clan' commands of induct and
outcast, but function to induct or outcast members from councils.
 
Coinduct will bring a new player into the council.
Cooutcast will remove them from the council.

1 COMBAT~
&cYou may choose a fight by finding a mob, and using &YLOOK&c,
&YCONSIDER&c, and &YIDENTIFY&c to gauge the difficulty of the opponent. 
You can &YLOOK <mob>&c to get a look at its equipment and description,
this will often help indictate how hard a fight might be.  You can
&YCONSIDER <mob>&c for a one on one comparison of the mobs hitpoints and
level to your own.  You may also &YFEEL 'KNOW ESSENCE' <mob>&c to get more
detailed information about the mob if you have force ability.  For those
that don't have this ability, a scanner can do the same thing. 
 
You may start a fight by using &YKILL&c, &YMURDER&c, or many powers and
skills available to players.  The easiest way to start a fight is to
&YKILL <mob>&c. Currently, you may also &YMURDER <mob>&c, but this causes
the mob to yell out. 
 
You may find yourself in trouble during a fight, and wish to leave, this
can be done by using &YFLEE&c.

1 COMMANDO CLASS~
&WCommando Class
&c
The commando class is a new type of class. It does not have its own levels,
but gives bonuses to a set of classes.  Instead of the 100 levels that a 
normal class gives to its main ability, the commando classes spreads it 
out. Combat gets 50, piloting gets 25, and smuggling gets 25.  
 
At the moment, there is only one of these classes. If this type of class is
in demand, others will follow. New skills with these classes in mind will 
also be added if this type of class is popular. 
 
Please post any comments you have on this type on the Suggestions boards.

contains. 
 
&YGET <item> <container>&c allows you to take one item from a container.
&YGET ALL <container>&c allows you to take everything from a container.
&YGET ALL.<item> <container>&c allows you to take all of a particular item
 
&YPUT <item> <container>&c puts an item inside a container. 
&YPUT ALL <container>&c will put as much of your inventory in the container
as possible, until the container is full.

1 CORELLIA~

&CInhabitants &W:&W Human, Drall, Selonian
&c
  Homeworld of Han Solo and Garm Bel Iblis, Corellia is located in the 
Corellian System, in the Corellian Sector of the galaxy, somewhere near 
the Core Worlds. It was once a democracy (in the days of Berethon e 
Solo), and reverted temporarily to a monarchy when Korol Solo tried to 
raise himself to kingship. Following his hanging, Corellia returned to 
being a republic (about 250 years before Han was born). Since then, it 
has become an introverted world, keeping mainly to intself and not 
getting involved with outside politics. The planet has a temperate 
ecology, with many large oceans.

    A planet in the Deep Core, located in the Bormea Sector. It is the 
primary planet in the Corulag System, and is a temperate world covered 
with forests and plains. A satellite of the Academy is located in the 
capital city of Curamalle. The planet's economy was maintained because 
of its position, located along the Perlemian Trade Route, as well as 
the presence of the Academy buildings. In many respects, Corulag was 
one of the most cosmopolitan worlds of the Empire.

1 CORUSCANT~
&CSystem &W:&Y Coruscant
&CInhabitants &W:&W Human, (Various)
&c
Located at galactic coordinates (0,0,0), this planet in the Core Worlds
was home to the Old Republic. Most xenoarchaeologists believe that the
human race evolved on Coruscant, which was also the homeworld of the 
Taung and the Zell races. It was renamed Imperial Center by Emperor 
Palpatine. When the New Republic was born, the planet was renamed to 
Coruscant. Located some 10,000 light-years from the actual galactic 
core, Coruscant had two moons and orbited a small white sun. The 
planet's entire landmass has been covered - over the thousands of 
generations spanning galactic history - by multiple levels of the 
buildings that make up Imperial City. The oceans which once covered 
part of the planet's surface had been drained and stored in vast, 
underground caverns for eventual reuse. Several of these immense 
skyscrapers reach over 6,000 meters into the atmosphere. This means 
that there is little land available for growing food, and no natural
rivers or lakes to provide water. To solve the dilemma of feeding and
watering millions of inhabitants, many of Coruscant's architects build
self-contained ecosystems into their buildings. Engineers have 
developed a series of huge pipes through which polar ice water is 
pumped to the cities. Nearly everything on the planet is recyclable, 
from clothing to packaging and machinery. One problem with a cityworld
like Coruscant was that it generated incredible amounts of carbon 
dioxide, so atmosphereic dampeners were placed in orbit to reactively
remove it. It was the center of all the Old Republic's activities, and
helped describe Galactic Standard time. The Imperial Senate was 
convened there. When Palpatine assumed control of the Senate and the 
rest of the government, he established that Coruscant would remain the
center of his Empire. He began a massive work effort to shape Coruscant
to his desires, including installing a large number of surveillance
systems. Following the Battle of Endor, Mon Mothma moved the New 
Republic onto Coruscant and again re-established the center of the
Republic there. This came after the planet was liberated from Ysanne
Isard, and the New Republic overcame the threat of the Krytos virus.

1 COUNCIL COUNCILS SENATE SENATOR GOVERNMENT GOVERNMENTS POWER~
There are three levels of government: 1. ORGANIZATIONS: The major player
run superpowers are the New Repubic, The Empire, and The Corperate
Authority. There are also several small organizations and crime families
operating independantly. Type CLANS for a list. 2. regional GOVERNMENTS:
These are small areas that may be controlled and profited from by player
organizations. They may be captured by organizations with the capture
command. Type GOVERNMENTS for a list. 3. The SENATE: The senate was
restored by the New republic shortly after the battle of Endor. It has
since then broken off its direct ties with the New Republic in order to
include the council heads from all worlds including Imperial controlled
worlds. The senate meets monthly at the traditional senate hall on
coruscant. However because of the difficulty that imperials face flying
near coruscant a shuttle has been set up that provides safe transportation
from a nuetral outpost to the Senate hall. The senate hall also has a
series of opinion booths were council heads can comunicate with their
people. These opinion booths are also used for electing new council heads.
Type SENATE for a list of senators.

1 COYNITE~
&COrigin&W:&Y Coyn
&c
     The fierce, warrior race which was native to the planet Coyn, the 
Coynites stand nearly three meters tall. Their bodies are covered with 
fine fur, which ranged in color from white or gold to brown and black. 
Their heads were crowned by a mane of longer hair, and the length of 
the mane indicated the individual's social status. Coynites are natural 
warriors, and almost always wear some form of battle armor and weapon. 
Xenobiologists have guessed that the average Coynite could live to be 
250 standards years old, but most males died in combat by the time they 
were 55. They hold to a rigid system of ritual and honor codes known as 
the En'Tra'Sol, that governed not only battle but politics. Offworlders 
have been killed for not adhering to this code. The Coynites respected 
and admired the Jedi Knights of the Old Republic, since the Jedi Code 
was similar to the En'Tra'Sol in many respects. One code is known as 
the Cradle Law.

1 CREATING HELPFILES~
Guess what? We need more helpfiles. 
 
Silphion is working on updating our old smaug ones, which... just don't
fit. 
 
What we need are good ones, about playing the game...
roleplay, money making, descriptions. 
Things that will help the newbie... things that only you players know. 
 
So, we are asking you to write some. 
 
Send them to Darrik@swrip.net.  We will review them. 
 
If we put them in the game, you will be rewarded. 
 
The reward of course, will be based on HOW good the help file is. 
 
The reward will most likely take the form of quest points. 
 
Don't worry, Naz is working on objects that you will be able to buy with
them.  Unbalanced Mandalorian Armor aside. 
 
That's all. Good luck, have fun. 
 
DV.

&CSystem &W:&Y Dagobah
&CInhabitants &W:&W Dragonsnake, Swampslug
&c
     Primary planet in the Dagobah system, this swamp planet was home
to Yoda. It is located in the Sluis sector. Near the end of the Bpfassh
Dark Jedi Insurrection, one of the fleeing Dark Jedi hid on Dagobah. No
one knows what happened to the Dark Jedi, but it is surmised that he 
died there. Furthermore, his knowledge of the Dark Side of the Force
caused the planet to be bathed in Dark Side energy. This might also
explain why the Jedi Master Yoda was able to hide on Dagobah during
Palpatine's purge of the Jedi, since his Light Side strength would have
been masked by the amount of Dark Side energy on the planet. The 
planet's day lasts 23 standard hours, and its year is 341 local days 
long.

1 DARRIK~
The came from the woodwork to listen to the fears,
Savoring the taste of a little child's tears.
Bogeyman in the closet, monsters under the bed, Terrors of the night
creeping into your head.
There's no place to hide when you are alone,
Under the covers shaking to the bone.
Take a deep breath and try to relax,
Try to forget the man with the axe.
But they whisper to you from deep in the night,
And you are too scared to turn on the light.
So fear the night terrors my dear little ones,
And pray for the rise of the new morning sun.

&c     Defel are an alien species that appear as large, red-eyed shadows
under most lighting conditions. For this reason, they are commonly 
referred to as "Wraiths". Under ultraviolet light, Defels appear as 
stocky, fur covered bipeds with protruding snouts and long, clawed, triple
jointed fingers. They stand about 1.3 meters tall, with shoulders as wide
as 1.2 meters across. 
     This species lives in underground cities on the planet Af'El, where
most inhabitants make their living through mining and metallurgy.  In the
galaxy at large, Defel often find employment as hired muscle, spies, and
assassins due to their shadowy forms.

1 DEXTERITY DEX~
&CDexterity &Y(dex)&C represents your character's agility and quickness. A
common concern with dexterity deals with how many items your character can
carry at once in his/her inventory.  For each additional point of
dexterity, you gain an additional amount of items you can carry.  A
character starts off being able to carry 5 items.  One's level also
affects how many things you can carry. 
 
&cDexterity also affects:
 
 * Improves natural armor class. *

 * Amount of movement points regenerated per tick. *
 
 * Chances of success of bash, poison weapon. *
 
 * Increases max piloting level. *
 
 * Increases max combat level. *

&cYou can dig and bury items through the use of the dig skill and bury
command.  Buried items are not easily visible to players.  To dig an item
up, type &Ydig&c with no arguments.  Having a shovel raises your chance
of success.  If you dig in a direction, you will attempt to dig open an
exit. 
 
To bury an item (or corpse), drop the item on the ground and &Ybury
&R&W<&YItem&R&W>&c.  Depending on the size and weight of the object, you
might need a shovel.
 
Items buried will not last beyond crash or reboot.  Do not attempt to use
this skill for storage of items you wish to keep.

0 DIPLOMACY DIPLOMAT~
&cThose who choose to be a diplomat also tend to have high leadership
abilities as well.  A diplomat's primary skill is mass propaganda, which
raises or lowers population support considerably.  Diplomats are needed in
the galaxy to deal with the citizens, and sway their way of thinking.  In
order to use many diplomatic skills, one must be a part of a clan or
organization.

&c     Droids are artifically intelligent beings built by various species,
for various uses.  They range in shape, model, and design, but most are
either humanoid in appearance or squat, cylindrical bodies topped by a
domed swiveling head.  They are all designed to perform one duty or
another, ranging from astromechs to protocol droids.  Most of them are
associated with mechanical devices or computer systems in one way or
another.  Majority of droids are loyal to their master without a single
rebellious thought in their programmed minds, but there has been rumors of
droids with their own free will, although it is rare.

&c
     This alien race resembles a small horse, although it is completely 
hairless. The Dug have leathery, grey skin and small, beady eyes. They 
can easily walk on their hind legs, their forelegs, or all fours. They 
used their four hands to help them move through the trees of their 
homeworld of Malastare. Much of their language is punctuated with 
knuckle rapping and foot stomping. Dugs became the sworn enemies of the 
Gran when a group of Gran established a settlement on Malastare. They 
fought viciously for many years before the Old Republic intervened. 
Unfortunately for the Dugs, the Republic ruled in favor of the Gran, 
and the Dugs were pushed to the fringes of Malastare's economy. Dug 
society became insular, and they turned into self-congratulatory 
braggarts.

     A humanoid race characterized by their blue skin, red eyes and

peaceful race (although the Star Wars Screen Entertainment software 
claims that they are reckless innature) and are considered dependable 
workers and gifted storytellers. Their society was formed many 
millennia before the Galactic Civil War, and was very advanced 
technologically. Most Duros are interested in space travel, and are 
employed in one of the many industries that deal in travel between the 
stars. Those Duros who remain near their homeworld work for one of the 
many starship construction facilities that orbit the planet Duro. Many 
of the Duros found off-planet are graduates of the Duro Academy of Deep 
Space Exploration, and can navigate a hyperspace jump with limited star 
charting. During the Galactic Civil War, the Duros were ostensibly 
loyal to the Empire, although the Empire established observation 
centers at many starship yards to keep an eye on them. During the 
Yuuzhan Vong invasion of the galaxy, many Duros felt that the New 
Republic was too lax in its defense against the alien invaders, and 
several Duros claimed that the galaxy would have been better prepared 
to defend itself if Emperor Palpatine had still been in power.

&c
Drink instructs your character to drink from a fountain or a drink container
to alleviate thirst.
 
Eat instructs your character to eat an item of food or a magical pill (which
function in a similar fashion as potions); pills do not fill stomach space.
 
When you are hungry or thirsty (you will see messages at each tick that
tell you if you are starving or dying of thirst, and can check your
current state with either 'score' or 'oldscore'), you will not regain
hitpoints, movement points or force back as rapidly as if you were well
fed and hydrated.
 
If you stay hungry or thirsty too long and you are not an Avatar, your
mental state will begin to suffer.  Your combat skills will be affected,
your coordination will suffer and you may begin to either hallucinate or
become depressed.  Eating, drinking and a little rest will solve this
problem after a short period of time.

101 ECONOMY~
Each area will initialize (on bootup of the mud) with a pool of gold based
on the area's range and the wealth of each mob in that area.
 
The shopkeepers and thieves will automatically deposit gold into the economy
if they are carrying more than a certain amount (the higher the level of the
shopkeeper, the greater they will carry before depositing).
 
To allow mobprogs to be created to manipulate area economies, making them
interactive and interdependent, there are two mpcommands:  mpdeposit, and
mpwithdraw (see related helpfiles).  There is also an 'if economy' ifcheck.
 
The aset command can also be used to adjust an area's economy by hand
(example:  aset <area filename> low_economy <amount>, this will give
the specified area a minimum economy at the level you set).
 
Mobs will not repop with more gold than what they were originally created
with, but if the area economy runs low they will begin to repop with less
until the economy is replenished (as they all share the same gold pool).
 
Use foldarea to make changes to an area's economy with aset permenent.

primitive weapons, like sling shots and bow and arrows, but their keen 
understanding of their environment and keen teamwork give Ewoks skills 
that just cannot be equaled, even by the most technologically advanced 
species.  Ewok religion focuses around the giant conifer trees in whith
they habitate.  Each village plants a seedling for every new ewok born and
nurture it as it grows.  Each ewok is linked to his or her totem tree, and
believe when they die, their spirit goes to live in their special tree. 
Curious by nature, they are prone to getting into trouble.  Their 
appearance makes them cute and charming to most other species, and ewoks 
use this to their advantage.  It's wise note to underestimate them for

101 EXITMAKING~
The 'redit exit' command is used to create, modify and remove exits in a room.
For more than one exit in the same direction see ADVANCEDEXITS.

The syntax of the 'redit exit' command is as follows:
redit exit <direction> [vnum] [exit-type] [key] [keyword(s)]
direction: one of: n, s, e, w, u, d, ne, nw, se, sw or ?
vnum     : the room number in which the exit leads to.
exit-type: a number detailing the exit -- has a door, open/closed/locked etc.
key      : a number corresponding to a key object which can unlock the door.
keywords : keywords used to refer to the door, (or exit).

If only 'redit exit <direction>' is specified, the exit will be removed.
The 'key' field is optional when specifying keywords.  All other fields are
required previous to the field desired.

Examples:
redit exit n 3001           - Creates an exit north to room 3001
redit exit n 3001 3 gate    - Changes the exit north to have a closed "gate"
redit exit n 3001 3 15 gate - Changes the gate to allow use of a key vnum 15
redit exit n                - Removes the north exit

See EXITTYPES for generating the exit-type value.
~

0 EXITS~
&CSyntax&W:&Y exits
&c
Tells you the visible exits of the room you are in.  Not all exits are
visible. You can use the 'bump' technique to find hidden exits.  (Try to
walk in a certain direction and see what you bump into).
~

101 EXITTYPES~
These are the currently valid exit-types:
      0 - Plain exit
      1 - Door exists         (Required to be closed or locked)
      2 - Door is Closed
      4 - Door is Locked
      8 - Door is Secret      (Trying to go that way won't reveal door)
     32 - Door is Pickproof   (Door can't be picked by power or skill)
     64 - Need to be able to fly to go that way
    128 - Need to be able to climb to go that way
   1024 - Door is Passdoor proof

NOTE: You must ADD the values together to generate an exit-type:
        3 = a closed door
        7 = a closed and locked door
       11 = a closed secret door
       15 = a closed, locked and secret door

-- Use the 'redit exflags' command to change these flags, and to set the
   advanced exit flags, most of which are not shown above.

See EXFLAGS and EXITMAKING.

&c
Your character advances in power by gaining experience.  Type &YLEVEL&c to

&CYou gain experience by:&c
    inflicting damage upon an opponent 
    being part of a group that kills an opponent

&CYou lose experience by:&c
    fleeing from combat
    recalling out of combat
    being the target of some powers (energy drain, etc.)
    dying
 
The experience you get from a kill depends on several things:  how many 
players are in your group; your level versus the level of the monster;
your alignment versus the monster's alignment and some random variation.
 
Your last 25 kills are recorded.  Each time you kill a creature that has
been one of your last 25 kills you will receive less and less exp for it.
The creature will also learn from its experience with you over time; if

101 FILENAMES~
When naming files, follow this convention:
* Areas should have the extension .are (though areas have their own
directory, when areasare modified they are moved to the building
directory, so it is best to have an
extension).
* Planets should have no extension (planets have their own
directory).
* Starsystems should have the extension .system (starsystems share the
space directory with ships).
* Ships should have the extension .ship (see starsystems for reason).
* Clans should have no extension (clans have their own directory).
Avoid using fullstops in file names, but use underlines (_) or dashes (-)
instead.

golden skin which turns silver when scarred. They possessed limited 
spacefaring technology, and had only recently perfected sublight travel 
when Hethrir convinced them to head for nearby planets while being held 
in hibernation. Those that were placed on the colony ships are the only 
surviving Firrerreo, because Hethrir later turned the planet over to 
the Empire, which destroyed the ecosystem with a biological weapon. 
Hethrir had been raiding the colony ships for slaves over the years, 
until his death at the hands of the being Waru. The Firrerreo have strong

This power enables the target character to float.  It is useful in saving
mv (movement points), makes a character float slowly to the ground when
falling from in the air, and allows you to move over water and through the
air.
 
Some water areas require the use of float to prevent damage from drowning.
If you are in an area and your movement suddenly begins to drop, then you
begin losing hps <hitpoints>, you should cast float immediately.
~

0 FLY~
Syntax:  cast 'fly' <character>
 
This power enables the target character to fly.  It is useful in saving
mv (movement points), preventing a character from falling when in the
air, moving over water or through the air, and in preventing an opponent
from tripping you.
 
Some water areas require the use of fly to prevent damage from drowning.

101 FOR~
Syntax:  for <argument> <command>
Syntax:  for <argument> <command> <target>
 
For allows an immortal to perform a command at or even on a large
number of targets.  The arguments include:  all, mobs, gods.
 
Example:  for gods gl, you will 'glance' in the room of every god
who is online (include link-dead)
 
You can also perform an action on the argument target.
Example:  for mobs poke #, you will perform the 'poke' social on
every mob in the game.
 
'For' does not override private flags.
~

101 FORCE~
Syntax:  force <victim> <command>
Syntax:  force all <command>
 
Force forces one mob or character to execute a command.
 
FORCE 'all' forces _all_ everywhere in the game to execute a command,
typically used for 'force all save'.
 
Note that the level required to use force on mobs can be different
than the level required to use force on players, and can be adjusted
via 'cset' (see 'help cset').
 
~

1 'FORCE IMBUE'~
&bForce Imbue (Dark Side, Light Side) 
 
&p&w     Imbue is a sacrificial roleplaying device. It is another way 
for Jedi and Dark Jedi masters to suicide and save a life or pass on 
their energy by death. When Imbue is used on another character who does
not have any ability in the force, it will fully restore them to life 
and also give them extra hitpoints from tight bonding with the force. 
Consider it a suicidal way to heal another person. When Imbue is used on
a student of the force (force level 5+) the student is able to absorb 
the energy given. The student gains no HP, but does advance their max 
force level and also raises their mana level to a corosponding amount. 
Permission to use this power will rarely be given, especially not to 
someone who simply wishes to suicide their forcer and give a friend a 
gift and use their clone. On this not note, be aware that the forcer who
sacrifices themselves for the player recieving, will lose the chance of
force capable clones. Also, if one is aiding a dying comrade, it must not
be due to a mob. It must be entirely player related. For imbuing between
two forcers, both players must be of the same alignment. 
~

101 FORCECLOSE~
Syntax: forceclose <descriptor>

This command will force a certain descriptor to close.
This is useful to disconnect connections that aren't really connected
due to a poor TCP connection.

It can also be used to forceclose a connection before a potential
problem player can even get to the authorization state of connection.

See USERS, CONSTATES and DISCONNECT.
~

1 FORCERS~
&cThe entire forcers system has been reset. Force able characters are
expected to RP properly. This means Dark Jedi are not out to save the
galaxy, and Light Jedi are not murdering fiends. For those of you new to
the SW Universe, Jedi are the protectors of justice and the innocent. Dark
Jedi are a more open class, because, although any action they do is
ultimately self benifiting, it may well aid an evil or good cause. Forcers
will no longer learn from mobs past the level of 5. Once a Dark/Light Jedi
passes their fifth level, they must turn to more experienced forcers under
the following system. 
&pMasters (Force max of 90-120)
&WKnight and Learners may be taught by masters.
&WMasters may teach a maximum of three students.
 
&YKnights (Force max of 30-89)
&WKnights may take on a single apprentice.
 
&RLearners (Force max of 1-29)
&WLearners may practice under Masters or Knights.
 
&GNOTES- There are NO Sith in this time period.
         Jedi may not join the Empire.
         Dark Jedi may join any group.
         RP correctly your forcer correctly, or
         your force will be removed. No excuses.
~

1 FORCE_RP~
&BLight Jedi RP&c
 - Jedi may enter any order/clan except the Empire without
   approval of the Admins
 - Jedi entering service/training within the Empire must seek 
   admin approval 
 - Jedi act only in defense 
 - Jedi are not to provoke attacks 
 - Jedi are not to purposefully cause trouble, lest they are sided 
   with a clan 
 
&RDark Jedi RP&W&c 
 - Being a Dark Jedi is not a license to kill 
 - Dark Jedi are interested in self profit or profit for the Dark 
   Side of the Force 
 - Dark Jedi may, with proper RP, innitiate an attack 
 - Dark Jedi cause trouble to suit their moods, or their profit 
 - Clanned Dark Jedi may attack, without warning, as long as 
   commanded to do so by their clan's hierarchy 
 - Dark Jedi may join ANY group, without approval of the admins 
 
&RRemember, your RP determines if you keep your force. Improper RP 
will bring about the removal of your force. So do nothing brash, or 
act without thinking about the consequences before hand.

Used to help in changing a character's password if they have forgotten or
misplaced their own.
 
This command will return the encrypted form of the specified password for
the specified character name.  Password and character name are case
sensitive, and the character name _must_ be capitalized.  The resulting
encrypted password must then be pasted into the character's pfile offline
by someone with access to player files.

101 FQUIT~
Syntax:  fquit <character>
 
Can be used by low-level imms to force a level 1 player to quit the game,
for example if the player is accidentally authorized or is causing problems
and there are no higher immortals around to deal with the problem.  Fquit
does not work on any player higher than level 1.

     This planet is the homeworld of the Gamorreans. It has a varied 
but temperate climate and ecology. The planet's poles are covered with 
frozen tundra, while the equator is covered with deep forests and 
jungles. The average day on Gamorr lasts 28 standard hours, and its 
year lasts 380 local days. There are very few large settlements on the 
planet, and the largest are controlled and populated by entire clans of 
powerful females.

upturned tusks.  They average in height of about 1.8 meters.  They make 
excellent heavy laborers and mercenaries due to their raw strength. 
Gamorreans are known for their irrational violent tendencies.  Their 
native world is the planet Gamorr.  The females handle most of the work 
load, while the males constantly train for war and fight.  They live in 
clans headed by matrons who order the males to fight from early spring to 
the late fall.  Often hired as personal bodyguards, Gamorreans are even 
hired as bounty hunters on occasion.

1 GAND~
&COrigin&W:&Y Gand
 
&c     A species of sentient life that has developed in the gases of the
planet Gand. Able to survive in the various gases, they require special
breathing apparatus in order to survive in oxygen-based atmospheres. 
The lungs of the Gand are quite efficient, able to utilize nearly 85 
percent of the atmosphere they breathe in with each breath. The Gand 
have developed a totalitarian monarchy, and various colonies of Gand 
live in pockets of mist in the gas giant's atmosphere. When renegade 
Gand are sought, findsmen are sent out to locate them. When the Empire
overran the planet, the findsmen were presented with advanced 
technology with which to hunt their targets. The better findsmen became
bounty hunters. The Gand hold their names in great reverence. A Gand 
who has accomplished nothing in his life is simply known as "Gand." 
When a Gand completes a task, they are given their family's surname. A
further accomplishment provides the Gand with a proper name. Pronouns
are almost never used, and are reserved for those famous Gand who have
accomplished so much that their deeds are known by all. If a Gand does
something to be ashamed of, or causes offense to another Gand, their 
name is reduced. It was discovered, after the Galactic Civil War, that
the Gand have certain regenerative properties.

shaggy gray fur.  The head cones serve as additional sensory organs, able
to pick up and distinguish different forms of energy waves.  Most other 
species feel uncomfortable around Gotals because of their additional 
senses.  For their part, Gotals do not like droids due to the high energy
output they give off, which tends to overload the Godals' senses.  They 
have a hard time interpreting the emotions of other alien species, often
mistaking affection for love and anger for hatred.  They make excellent

&c
     A race of three-eyed humanoids native to the planet Kinyen, the 
Gran have tan skin. Their eyes are set out away from their heads on 
thick stalks, and they have large ears. Their eyes are adapted for 
seeing into the visible spectrum as well as the infrared spectrum. They
evolved from a herbivorous species, and have two stomachs to digest 
their food. The females have three breasts, which they use to suckle 
their young. In general, Gran are peaceful and hospitable, and no 
conflicts have been noted in their 10,000 year history. They are 
strongly attached to their families and their race in general; all Gran
mate for life, with the survivor usually dying of a broken heart hortly
after its mate's death. Their infrared sight allows the Gran to detect
their companion's emotional state. The Gran race was hesitant to join
the galactic community of the Old Republic, fearing that they would 
become diluted by huge distances. They remained isolated from the 
Republic, for the most part, and the Old Republic respected their 
wishes. After the birth of the New Order, the Gran organized peaceful
protests against Palpatine's rule. However, they were quickly 
subjugated by the Empire. On their own, the Gran developed space travel,
and have developed a healthy trade route with the Herglics.

1 HAPES~
&CSystem &W:&Y Hapan
&CInhabitants &W:&W Human
&c
    Originally settled by a group of pirates called the Lorell Raiders,
the planet Hapes later became a neutral system when the Jedi Knights 
wiped out the Raiders when they started making raids into Old Republic
supply centers. The surviving women swore never to let a man run the 
government following this defeat. The system was later overrun by the
Empire, but Ta'a Chume (the Queen Mother at the time) built a powerful
armed forces and drove the Imperial out. The Hapans are known for their
belligerence. The planet orbits the star Hapes, and has been the seat 
of the Hapan government for as long as anyone can remember. The planet
has seven moons. The light from these moons, as well as from the star
Hapes, has caused the natives to lose much of their ability to see at
night. The average day on Hapes lasts 22 standard hours, and the year
on Hapes encompasses 240 local days.

101 HEDIT~
Syntax:  hedit [help topic]
 
This command allows you to edit a help topic.  If the specified help topic
does not exist, it will be created for you.  The default help page (summary)
will be selected if you do not specify a page.
 
NOTE - Always, when creating a new help entry, type Help <new entry name>
       prior to creating your entry. A pre-existing help file associated
       with that keyword may already exist.
&Y
Colors &wcan now be added to help files using the same command set that changes
a player prompt.  &bMultiple &Ycolor &wcombinations can be set on a given line
including ^bbackground^x colors.  However, there are a couple of quirks to take
note of:
&Y
    1) If the first line of your help file containers a color code and you are
       experiencing a display problem with the file, use a . to begin the file.
    2) Color changes should be separated by at least one character.  Example:
       '&&Y.^^r' will work, '&&Y^^r' may cause problems.

101 HELL UNHELL~
Syntax: hell <character> <number> <hours or days>
Syntax: unhell <character>
 
The hell command sends a character to hell for a given period of time.  It
automatically releases the character when their time has been served.  Upon
being helled, the character receives the message, "The immortals are not 
pleased with your actions.  You shall remain in hell for <time period>."
 
Hell takes arguments of either hours or days.  To hell someone for 3 hours,
"hell <character> 3 hours."  To hell someone for three days, "hell <character>
3 days".  Hell will default to hours if hours or days is not specified.

To release a player from hell early, simply "unhell <character>".

100 HELPFILE FILE HELPFILES~
To edit/make a help file there are some basic and yet confusing
commands
necessary.  So here we go...
hedit <helpfile>
hset level 1 <helpfile>
hset keyword "<word list>" <helpfile>
hset save <helpfile>
~

1 HIJACK~
&CSyntax &R&W: &YHijack

~

1 HITALL~
Syntax: hitall
 
~

1 HLIST~
Syntax: hlist <low level range> <high level range>
 
This command will give you a listing of available help files. The list
is in alphabetical order based on the first triggering keyword. While
this command was initially designed as a maintenance tool to help us
track help files, it is also available to players so that they can
capture a listing of the help files available to them. 
 
Note - You may only view help files that are coded for viewing by your
       level or lower.
 
Note - The list of help files is quite extensive, and the command does
       not as yet have a way to filter/shorten the list. Screen capture
       is, at present, your only recourse.

0 HOLD REMOVE WEAR WIELD~
Syntax:  hold   <object>
Syntax:  remove <object>
Syntax:  remove all
Syntax:  wear   <object>
Syntax:  wear   all
Syntax:  wield  <object>
 
Three of these commands will cause you to take an object from your inventory
and use it as equipment:
 
HOLD is for lights, wands and staves; WEAR is for armor; WIELD is for weapons.
 
You may not be able to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD an item if its alignment does not
match yours, if it is too heavy for you, or if you are not experienced enough
to use it properly.
 
WEAR ALL will attempt to HOLD/WEAR/WIELD each suitable item in inventory.
 
REMOVE will take an object from your equipment and place it into inventory.
 
REMOVE ALL will remove all your equipment and place it into inventory.
 
~

101 HOLYLIGHT INVIS~
Syntax: holylight
Syntax: invis

HOLYLIGHT is a toggle that allows you to see (almost) every character and
mobile in the game.  With holy light, you can see what's in the game more
easily.  Without holy light, you can see what mortal players see.

INVIS is a toggle which makes you completely invisible to all player characters
of lower level than you, and to all mobiles.

When an immortal is INVIS, they will have a flag on the who list which 
indicates their level of invisibility, such as (51) for INVIS 51.  A 
similar flag will also appear when you 'LOOK' in a room - this flag will 
say (Invis 51).

HOLYLIGHT will not allow you to see immortal INVIS characters who are
higher level than you.
~

10 HOMEPAGE~
syntax: homepage <url>
 
example: homepage http://www.idirect.com/test.html
 
If you have a web page somewhere, you can use the homepage
command to show people a link to that page whenever they
select the 'see who's on' link from the Realms of Despair
home page.
 
To remove your homepage setting, type 'homepage clear'.

1 HONOGHR~
&CSystem &W:&Y Honoghr
&CInhabitants &W:&W Noghri
&c
     This once-lush paradise of a planet is the homeworld of the 
Noghri, and was virtually unknown until it was nearly devastated 
following a starship battle in its orbit. The Emperor, upon discovering 
the Noghri, conceived of a plot to enslave Noghri, with the help of 
Darth Vader. The huge space battle took place above the planet, and one 
of the ships was destroyed. It plummeted to the planet's surface, 
setting off earthquakes and releasing toxic chemicals into the 
atmosphere. When Vader arrived to offer aid, the Noghri readily 
accepted, and made Vader their Lord and Savior. However, Palpatine had 
arranged that the decon droids sent to the planet would continue to 
poison it by planting modified kholm grass. This modified grass would 
choke out all other vegetation, while making it appear that the planet 
could still support life.
 
&RSee also&W:&P HONOGHRRULES

1 HONOGHRRULES~
&c
Honoghr is the planet of the Noghri.  Heavily controlled by the Empire 
in this timeline.  It's space is patrolled by an agressive fleet.  Any 
ship entering their space will be destroyed. 
 
Once rediscovered by the Empire, that fleet may allow imperial ships 
in.  Anyone entering the Empire, and proceeding to Honoghr, without 
IC reason to do so, will be helled and any equipment from the planet 
confiscated. 
~

1 HOTH~
&CSystem &W:&Y Hoth
&CInhabitants &W:&W Wampa, Tauntaun
&c
     This snow planet is the sixth planet in the Hoth system, located 
in the Ison Corridor. It orbits a distant, blue-white star, and has 
three natural satellites. Just outside the orbit of Hoth is a huge 
asteroid belt, which is believed to be the result of the collision of 
two planets eons ago. Its remote location made it the perfect site for 
an Alliance base three years after the Battle of Yavin. It orbits its 
star inside a treacherous belt of asteroids, making any approach to the
planet very hazardous. Many smaller asteroids get pulled in by Hoth's 
gravity, and rain down on the planet as meteors. The planet's normal
daytime temperature was some thirty-degrees below zero, and its
high-
velocity wind and snow storms make it extremely inhospitable. Hoth has
a fair amount of seismic activity, which is constantly changing the 
various ice formations and creating vast, natural ice caves and 
tunnels. It is for these reasons that Alliance Major Kem Monnon chose
it for Echo Base. Its harsh, frozen climate has given rise to only two
major lifeforms, the Wampa ice creature and the tauntaun. Small 
rodents, wirelike ice worms, and hardy lichens complete a minimal 
foodchain.

1 'HP'~
This is an abbreviation for hit points.  All classes begin with 20 hp
at creation and gain between 6 and 19 hp per gained level, depending on
class, race and CON.  Equipment can also add to your total hp.

1 'HRD' 'HUMAN REPLICANT DROID'~
&pHuman Replicant Droid:
 
&YOnly assassin droids will be allowed to roleplay as HRDs, and even
then only with the express permission of a Head Admin. Gladiator droids
and protocol droids and the like will not be allowed to.
~

101 HSET~
Syntax:  hset  <command> [value] [help topic]
 save                            Saves all help pages (to help.are)
 level <level> <help topic>      Sets help topic to specified level
 keyword <keyword> <help topic>  Sets help keyword to specified keyword
 remove <level.><help topic>     Removes the specified help page
 
Note:  If you wish to set more than one keyword to a help topic, enclose all
       the keywords, space separated inside quotes.  (Like in powercasting)
Note:  If you have instances of multiple help files with the same keyname,
       using Hset Remove without a level designation will remove the one with
       the lowest level of access. ie:
 
       Help file XYZZY at level 57, and help file 'SAVE XYZZY' at level 58.
       Typing 'HSET REMOVE XYZZY' will remove the level 57 XYZZY.
       Typing 'HSET REMOVE 58.XYZZY' will remove the level 58 'SAVE XYZZY'.

0 HUMAN HUMANS~
&GOrigin: &YVarious

     &gHumans are the most numerous and least unusual of the races. They
possess no special abilities or bonuses, but also have no penalties. 
Because of that, humans are extremely adaptable and are able to assume a
variety of classes and roles 
     Humans are bipedal beings, boasting two arms, two legs, and a roundish
head.  Amazingly, they have a strange tendency to look different from each
other, almost none look exactly alike.

0 HUTT HUTTS~
&POrigin: &YVarl

&p     Hutts resemble large slug-like creatures, having no legs and very
short stubby arms.  They can use their muscular tails to slither forward,
much like a snake.  Most hutts use hoversleds or repulsor lifts to ferry
themselves around however.  They are hermaphrodites, containing both male
and female reproductive organs.  A Hutt's skin is impervious to most
weapons and is highly protected against poisons.  Hutts are alos notably
arrogant and consider themselves to be the supreme race.  Originally from
the planet Varl, they escaped disaster on their homeworld many millenia
ago.  They migrated to the planet Nal Hutta, which means "Glorious Jewel"
in their language.  Throughout the galaxy's history, Hutts have been the
tough, immoral, criminal underlords by taking and excercising power and
control over other beings.  They live long, some claim to be nearly 1000
years old.  Their business philosophy is known as 'Kajidic', which means
"Somebody's going to have it, so why not it be us?"

0 IC OOC "IN CHARACTER" " OUT OF CHARACTER"~
&C

IC - In character - Means that you're not chatting with your friends about
friday nights plans, or what to wear to the mall, it means what your MUD
CHARACTER is saying. Ignorance is  no excuse for misusing channels, if you
mean to jokingly tell someone OOC you're going to kill them but do it IC
they have every right to defend themselves and attack you if they feel
threatened. You can use the ask and answer, as well as tell channels (if
you don't understand  them there's a reason someone teaches languages)
if;you want to talk OOC or just go to a hotel, it's not that difficult and
it's cheaper then using IC and clears up any confusion and lessens whining
because someone was killed because they "accidentally said the wrong
thing on the wrong channel".
&Y
OOC - Out of Character - Means you're talking about issues not
game related like a bug or have another mud-based question, this
does not mean you go "Hey Jim I need food pick me up" or "Hey 
So and So just killed me I'm gonna get you!" however there are a 
constantly growing number of help files and most of your basic 
questions should be there for answering, but yes there are times
here there are questions only an imm or a fellow player can answer.
However Excessive abuse of OOC will result in possibly being silenced.

1 IDENTIFY ID~
&cAny ship can ask for an identify, if it is &YIC&c.  Details will be asked
on any pkill, a ship pkill especially, so be prepared to explain why your
actions were &YIC&c.
 
It is HIGHLY inadvisable to go AFK, while you are in a ship.  Being AFK is
NOT an excuse if you are killed when you did not ID.  A ship requesting an
ID does not know if you are AFK, so they can legally kill you.  There will
be no player restores or punishments given out if you are killed in a ship
while afk. 
 
&cTo ID yourself, type: 

           &Ysystem &R&W<&Yship name&R&W>&Y ID: &R&W<&YYour name&R&W> 
 
&cWhen IDing a ship, remember to have the name of the ship you are IDing.

First, I would like to start off saying that this is a roleplay 
mud.  This means, that ooc information and ooc identities have 
absolutely nothing to do with the actions on the mud. Half of 
the immortals on this mud were imm'd because of respect gained 
in their use of roleplay and their ability to distinguish 
between OOC and IC.  That ability does not disappear over time, 
believe me.  That is why they act as RP police, and most of 
them have kept their mortals, for the same reason they started 
to play here, they love roleplaying.
Lately, these people have been getting harrassed by people
who walk up to them and talk to them, or even taunt them, oocly, 
as if they were the person in front of the monitor, instead of 
the character they play here.  This blatant disregard for 
roleplay is disrespectful to all involved. This is an rp-enforced 
mud. Anyone continuing to do this will be dealth with properly.

We allow mortal's here on RiP for two reasons. The first, the 
obvious, is that the immortals here mostly came to play, and 
became staff later. They enjoying playing RiP, and wish to 
continue to do so. "That's great!" you say, "but they do not 
need to hide who their morts are!" Ah, but they do, for the
second reason, which is to get the feel of the 
mud. Several times, the implementors have found that the mud's 
population has gone down over the last week, and they wonder 
why. Well, asking the question over the imm channel gives a 
few great ideas, and implementing these ideas has brought the 
population up once again.  If everyone on the mud can honestly 
say they will talk as freely and openly to someone they know 
is an immortal as they would to a long-time roleplayer, then 
I am sure every immortal would be happy to tell you who they 
play as, since their characters is a point of pride for everyone.

101 INSTAROOM INSTAZONE~
Syntax:  instaroom
 
Functions the same as instazone, but is room-based instead of area-based.
 
Syntax:  instazone [nodoors]
 
This command lets your instantly create a whole set of resets for your area
based on all the mobiles and objects contained within your area.
All you have to do is place each mob in its proper room, wearing what it
should be wearing, carrying what it should be carrying, and objects in their
proper places, or in their proper containers, and doors in their proper
states, (open, closed, locked).  The instazone command will clear out your
current resets (if any), and create new ones for you.
You may optionally specify "nodoors" so that door resets will not be
created.
 
NOTE:  This command will wipe out any existing resets!  Do not use this
command after you have added your own resets with 'reset add'.
The recommended procedure is to use instazone, then use the 'reset' command
to add any special resets, and NOT use instazone again.
 
See RESET and RESETCMDS.

101 IRULES~
Immortal Rules:
 
* No unnecessary action is to be taken against players. If a player is
causing trouble, a warning is to be first given, followed by hell if
necessary. Slay and such commands are highly discouraged and immortals
caught using them unnecessarily will be
seriously dealt with.

* No bogus items are to be created (rooms, objects, areas, etc.) This makes
the db messy and is hard to clean up.
* Do not create too many items for personal use. One ship is of course ok
but don't go overboard.
 
* For immortals who can promote players to immortals, no player is to be
given immortal status without consulting the other
imms.
The same goes for promoting immortals. This includes commands such as
trust, etc. (Yes, this includes me too.)

&COrigin: &YIthor 
 
     &cThe species name for the aliens commonly referred to as Hammerheads
is Ithorian. Their common name comes from their T-shaped heads, which rest
atop long, curved necks. Ithorians come from the Ottega star system, in 
the Lesser Plooriod Cluster. They speak Basic with a strange twist due to
their two mouths, each located on one side of their necks. This generates
a stereo effect, which produces one of the most beautiful and difficult 
native languages in the galaxy. 
     Ithorians are a gentle, peace loving species and as such they are 
particularly adept at healing, but much worse in fights that they have 
provoked. They have great respect for all forms of life, making them 
particularly bad bounty hunters. They are gregarious and curious people,

homespun cloak with hoods around their bodies with only their glowing eyes
being visible.  Having a clan mentality, they live and travel in bands 
using giant treaded vehicles known as 'sandcrawlers'.  They are very 
family oriented, and collect any kind of junk that doesn't have an owner 
attached to it.  They love to barter and make deals, as well as trade with
other races.  Once a year, each clan makes the trek across the Dune Sea

exchange salvaged items and tell stories of their greatest trades made to

settled Kashyyyk after travelling from another planet. There are four
main continents on the planet, separated by bands of ocean studded with
archipelagoes. There is a small region of desert near the equator. The
Wookiees live in huge tree cities built to elevate them from the 
dangerous lower levels of the jungle. The Wookies discovered that the
jungle had seven distinct levels, each defined by the amount of light
it receives. The lower levels - designated first, second, and third -
have plants which are phosphorescent, providing their own light. 
Wookiees never traveled below the fourth level. The normal Kashyyyk

     A planet with large spice mining operation, Kessel is the second

has no natural atmosphere, so one is generated by huge processors. It
has one moon. Kessel is doomed to be swallowed by the nearby Maw in the
next few millennia, as the intense gravity of the multiple black holes
draw it in. It was used as an Imperial penal colony, with an Imperial
garrison stationed on the moon. The prisoners were used as spice 
miners. The miners work in near-absolute darkness, so as not to 
activate the spice. When Emperor Palpatine died at Endor, the Imperials
stationed there were not prepared for autonomy. When the prisoners 
heard about the death of the Emperor, they revolted against the 
Imperial guards, overthrowing them and establishing control of the 
planet and the production of spice. Moruth Doole, a prisoner who had 
risen to the top of the Imperial's list, became the de facto ruler of 
the mines. He continued to use the lowest of the prisoners as spice 
miners, keeping a handful of the upper-level prisoners as advisors and
crew chiefs. Doole had the atmospheric production reduced in an effort
to save money; he felt that since the prisoners worked underground, an
above-ground atmosphere was a frivolous waste of money.

1 KUBAZ~
&COrigin&W:&Y Kubindi
&c
     An alien race hailing from the planet Kubindi, the Kubaz have dark 
reen skin, a prehensile trunk, and large eyes. Their eyes are sensitive 
to the red spectrum of light, and often wear large goggles when they 
are away from their homeworld. They tend to be clan-oriented, with each 
clan protecting its property from other rival clans. The intense solar 
flares from their planet's sun nearly destroyed the majority of food 
sources on the planet, and the Kubaz were forced to hunt insects as a 
staple diet. This led to the rival clans raiding each others' insect 
farms. These so-called Hive Wars were resolved when the Kubaz found a 
way to alter the genetics of their insects to not only improve their 
reproduction, but to identify each hive by its colorings as property of 
a certain clan. This newly-formed science of Insecticulture helped keep 
the rival clans from feuding, and also allowed the Kubaz to expand 
their horizons. They eventually discovered space travel, and eventually 
populated three of the 11 worlds orbiting the sun Ku'Bakai. This ability 
to move off-planet then introduced the Kubaz to their neighbors, the 
Verpine. Since the Verpine are an insectile race by nature, the space- 
faring Kubaz found that the Verpine were tasty, and began to hunt them 
as an additional food source.

be layered with this item. Items of clothing can be layered over one another
as long as their layer values do not overlap. ie, if leather armor were set
to a value of 56 (8, 16, and 32), it could not layer with, say, a set of
heavy chain that is set to a value of 96 (32 and 64), as they overlap on the
layer value of 32.

0 LEADERSHIP LEADER~
&cPlayers that pick leadership as their main get a few interesting
abilities.  Not only can they post guards, but they can post *elite*
guards, as well as call special forces, a more powerful form of
reinforcements.  They also receive dominate, which will make a mob your
follower, and torture, which will permanently remove the hit points from a
person or a mob.  A leadership centered character is usually weaker in
areas such as combat and piloting, and stronger in diplomacy.

~

101 LOG SNOOP~
Syntax:  log   <character>
Syntax:  log   all
Syntax:  snoop <character>
 
LOG <character> causes all of a character's commands to be logged into the
server's log file and to the log channel.  Like FREEZE, it is a permanent
character toggle that persists across reboots until removed.
 
Certain commands (such as password) are protected against LOG.  Conversely,
certain commands (especially immortal commands) are always logged.
 
LOG ALL logs all character and mob commands and actions to the server's log
file, but does not send the output to the log channel.  It is a server-wide
toggle; it does not persist across reboots.
 
SNOOP shows you a copy of all the input and output going to a character.  The
character must have an open channel.  You may snoop more than one character
at a time.  The input from the player will be displayed with a header of the
players  name and a percentage sign (i.e. Mudder%)
 
SNOOP yourself to cancel all outstanding snoops.

0 MON_CALAMARI 'MON CALAMARI'~
&COrigin&W: &YMon Calamari
 
&c     The Mon Calamari are a bipedal, amphibious species who come from a
planet with the same name.  They are shore-dwellers with an affinity for
water, and have developed a symbiotic relationship with the water-dwelling
Quarren.  With the Quarren to mine ore from the ocean floor and the Mon 
Calamari to design practical uses for the metal, the great floating 
cities of Mon Calamari were built. 
     These cities extend above and below the water, and the technology was
eventually used to create orbiting space platforms.  The Mon Calamari see
space as an endless ocean of stars, and they were tempted to explore 
those depths from the earlist periods of their civilization.  First they
colonized their own star system, then they discovered the secret of the
hyperdrive.  But before they could reach out to find the galactic community
they dreamed of, they met the Empire.

You feel yourself leaving your body... rising up into the air, you feel

You float high into the heavens... a vortex of ever-changing curved beams
of colored light swirling around you faster and faster...

Your soul is bursting with emotions you can barely conceive...
You feel a burning inside... both cold and hot... a tingle of electricity
grows into a powerful buzzing surge jolting through every inch of your body.

A strange chorus of voices begins to sing indecipherable and long forgotten
words... the singing grows louder and louder... a million voices as one.

You feel yourself losing touch with reality... and all goes quiet.

...You begin to feel light-headed.

visions of worlds of wonder, far off places, great towers, vast mountains,
oceans, seas, lush valleys, dark caverns and twisted passages...
 
You sense a feeling of wonderous potential and power in your hands...
Enough power to build and create these visions for yourself!

You feel much more powerful, eager and inspired!
~

-1 M_GODLVL3_~
...You feel slightly faint as your head begins to spin.

Your hands begin to tingle once more...
A vortex of energy starts to swirl throughout your hands, going faster
and faster... becoming almost painful! 

Beams of light break through your skin, one at a time, then more and
more until the light is almost to bright to bear...

As your squint your eyes, you perceive a vision of great beasts of wonder,
dangerous and unnatural fiends, pixies, faeries, tribes and clans, peoples
of all kinds, ancient forgotten artifacts, weapons of vast untapped powers,
crystal balls, magick rings, staves, wands, rods, arcane tomes of untold
secrets... your mind is bursting with inspiration...
 
You sense a new, reborn feeling of unlimited potential and power...
In your hands the power to build and create these visions for yourself!

The bright light from your hands fades away... but strange faint glow
remains always.

one time known as Evocar, and was inhabited by the Evocii race. The 
Hutts, fleeing the desolation of Varl, settled on Evocar as a suitable 
home. They began trading technology to the Evocci for land, and 
continued to do so until they owned most of the planet. The Evocii 
realized what was happening, but too late. The Hutts began construction 
on a multitude of palaces and pleasure sites before the Evocii could do 
anything about. Their appeals to the Old Republic were taken seriously, 
but the contracts they signed with the Hutts were ironclad in favor of 
the Hutts. Even the Jedi Knights were powerless. The Hutts forced them 
off the planet and onto Nar Shaddaa, where they were eventually mutated 
over the years by the various technologies in use on the moon. The 
planet is ruled by the oldest Hutt families, who control Nar Shaddaa 
from their homes. The planet is huge, but it has no natural heavy 
metals. Thus, its density is less than expected. Its day lasts 87 
standard hours, and its year is 413 local days in duration. What 
remains of the planet's natural landscape is flat, marshy bogs. In the
aftermath of the Battle of Fondor and the duplicitous actions of Borga
the Hutt, the Yuuzhan Vong targetted Nal Hutta for destruction. The 
Vong bombarded the planet from a remote location, although many of the
missiles exploded in the atmosphere.

0 NAME NAMES~
&c
The name of your character is very important.  As we are trying 
to keep this a Role Play Mud please pick reasonable names. 
Names of well known start wars characters are frownd upon 
and names with profanity or just plain stupid will be denied. 
In addition, "common names" that are used by our unoriginal 
world of today will also be denied. 
&w
i.e. Luke, Vader, Han are well known names.
i.e. Fish Head, Supermanguy, are just plain stupid.
i.e. Jake, Michael, Jessica are too common a
name.

1 'NAR SHADDAA'~
&CSystem &W:&Y Y'Toub (Nal Hutta's moon-planet)
&CInhabitants &W:&W Evocii, Hutt, Human
&c
Nal Hutta's spaceport moon, known for its vertically-built cities, 
experienced spaceship mechanics and its lawlessness. It is a center for
smuggling operations, and is supposedly where Han Solo learned the 
smuggler's trade as a youth. When the Hutts took over the moon, they 
began using it as a spaceport, and soon huge refueling spires and 
repair facilities reached up from the ground into orbit. There is no
observable land mass left on Nar Shaddaa, since the spaceports have
grown around the spires and now completely cover the planet. The moon
was uninhabited during the time that the Evocii lived on Nal Hutta, 
although they called it Evocar. When the Hutts took over the planet,
they relegated the Evocii to Nar Shaddaa. However, the Hutts used them
as semi-free slaves on the moon, and the press of so many various 
species and technologies eventually mutated the Evocii. Nar Shaddaa is
similar to its parent planet, having a day which lasts 87 standard 
hours, and a year which lasts 413 local days. It is tide-locked with 
Nal Hutta, and only shows one side to its planet. This results in a day 
which has two distinct periods of ligthness: one in which is is in full 
view of the sun, and one in which it obtains light reflected from Nal 
Hutta. This also results in two periods of night.

If you get stuck on anything, use the newbie channel and 
hopefully someone will be able to help you. 
 
&YNewbie <msg>&R&W
 
If someone yells at you that the question is IC, Do not be put off. Read
the help files IC and Roleplay. Rephrase the question so it is in

To the east of Menari Spaceport on Coruscant is a building 
that contains several job opportunities, some of which 
might be good for newbies to earn money. 

Most rental ships can be found on Menari Spaceport on Coruscant, 
although there are some spread around the other planets.

100 NOKILL KILL NO~
A 'nokill' flag has been added for NAMED mobs. It doesn't make sense
for some mobs to die and then suddenly be back alive again ( the ones
with names as opposed to ones like anonymous stormtroopers etc ).
This flag will cause the mob that has it to appear to flee before it
dies... It will still give experience but won't leave a corpse lying
around.

1 'ORD MANTELL'~
&CSystem &W:&Y Bright Jewel
&CInhabitants &W:&W Human, Savrip
&c
     The planet on which Han Solo was almost captured by bounty 
hunters, including Boba Fett, prior to the Battle of Hoth. Ord Mantell 
was known for its lenient banking laws and their flexibility. It was 
settled some 12,000 before the Battle of Endor by Corellian colonists 
as an advanced military outpost for the Old Republic. Over time, more
wealthy planets and better hyperspace routes diminished Ord mantell's
strategic importance, but became something of a free port for all 
manner of freighters and cargo ships. Despite the planet's dropping 
stature, it remained known as the Heart of the Bright Jewel, orbiting
the blue star at the center of the Bright Jewel System. The planet is
famous for its thick, outer cometary cloud, which has been the site of
the Blockade Runners Derby for nearly 100 years. It is also one of 
Thrawn's feint attacks just prior to his attack on Coruscant. It has 
two moons, and has a temperate environment. It claimed to be free of 
Imperial interest, but Han Solo discovered an Imperial fleet on 
maneuvers when he arrived there. It was at a starship scrapyard on Ord 
Mantell that Dash Rendar, working to locate information on Han Solo's 
whereabouts for Lando Calrissian after the debacle at Cloud City, ran 
into IG-88 and other bounty hunters. The bounty hunters were trying to 
intercept Boba Fett, who was transporting Han Solos frozen body to 
Jabba the Hutt.

0 ORDER~
&CSyntax &W:&Y order <character> command
&CSyntax &W:&Y order all command
 
&YORDER&c orders one or all of your charmed followers (including pets) to
perform any command.  The command may have arguments.  You are responsible
for the actions of your followers, and others who attack your followers
will incur the same penalty as if they attacked you directly. 
 
Most charmed creatures lose their aggressive nature (while charmed). 
 
If your charmed creature engages in combat, that will break the charm. 
~

101 OSET~
Syntax:  oset <object>    <field> <value>
         oset object on
 
If the copy of the object you are currently modifying has the PROTOTYPE flag,
your modifications will also modify the index of that object, which all other
instances of the object are based on.  In the future, every copy of that obj
will reflect your modifications.
 
Also be aware that modifications to the object affect list (everything that
is listed after 'object values') will affect _every_ copy of that object in
the game, including old copies (even if they are not online).  Thus if you
change a prototype-flagged copy of a sword to +4 damroll, every copy of that
vnum ever made will reflect that change.  If you add a 'magic' flag to that
sword, however, only copies made after the change will be affected.
 
If the copy of the object you are modifying does NOT have the PROTOTYPE flag,
your modifications will affect only that copy.
 
OSET ON will lock you onto a particular object.  Once locked on, all commands
commands will imply 'oset <object>'.  Hitting enter while in OSET ON gives
you an ostat of the object you are working on.  To get out of OSET ON, simply
type the word DONE. Example:
 
        oset staff on
        long A long gnarled staff of burnished oak lies here.
        type staff
        done

0 QUARREN~
&COrigin: &cMon Calamari 

&c     Quarren is a species named for the aliens who are commonly called
Squid Heads by the galaxy's general populace.  These amphibious beings 
share the world of Calamari with the Mon Calamari race, though the Quarren
prefer the depths of the floating cities to the upper reaches the Mon Cals
call home.  The Quarren are more practical and conservative than their 
idealistic world-mates.  Whereas the Mon Calamari have adopted Basic as 
their language of choice, the Quarren have kept their oceanic tongue.  
They are sea dwellers, able to live out of the water, but preferring the 
security of the ocean dephts.  These pragmatic people are unwilling to 
trust new ideas.  They do not dream of a brighter tomorrow like the Mon 
Cals, but instead hold fast to the reality of yesterday.  While they 
profess that the two races should remain in the sea, they have followed 
the Mon Cals into their floating cities and out among the stars.  They 
have become dependant on the Calamarians, and this dependancy has led to 
resentment and outright hatred.  Rumors persist that it was a small number
of Quarren who helped the Empire originally invade the planet.  In the 
face of invading forces, Quarren cooperated with the Mon Calamari to repel
the Imperials, but since that day, many Quarren have fled the planet to 
seek a life elsewhere in the galaxy.  They seem to have purposely remained
apart from both the Alliance and the Empire, preferring to find a place on
the fringes of society.  Quarren can often be found working with pirates,
slavers, crime lords, smugglers, and other unsavory sorts.

~

101 RASSIGN MASSIGN OASSIGN~
Syntax:  rassign <character> <begin vnum range> <end vnum range>
 
These commands allow you to assign a range of vnums to an immortal for
so that they may build inside that range.  Use the 'checkvnums' command
before assigning a range to ensure that there will be no vnum conflicts.
You can also use the 'vnums' command for a complete list of currently
allocated ranges, and the 'newzones' command for a complete list of
prototype vnum ranges.
 
Warning:  *Never* assign any vnums to a character who has another vnum
range assigned to them via 'aassign'.  Simply be sure to have the
character type 'aassign none' before assigning vnums to them.
 
Example:  massign Joseph 9000 9099
 
This will assign the vnum range from 9000 to 9099 for rooms to Joseph.
It is best to keep an areas object, room and mob range the same.
 
Be sure to always use 'checkvnums' to ensure the vnums you are going to
assign are clear.

101 REBOOT SHUTDOWN WIZLOCK~
Syntax: reboot <nosave>
Syntax: shutdown <nosave>
Syntax: wizlock

REBOOT shuts down the server.  When the normal 'startup' script is used
to control the server, a delay of sixty seconds will ensue (to allow
old connections to die), followed by a reboot.

SHUTDOWN shuts down the server and prevents the normal 'startup' script
from restarting it.

WIZLOCK is a toggle command.  When the server is WIZLOCKed, players
below level 51 may not log in.  Players who lose their links, however,
may reconnect.

If nosave is specified for reboot or shutdown, it will not automatically 
save all of the players.

0 REST SLEEP STAND WAKE~
Syntax: rest
Syntax: sleep
Syntax: stand
Syntax: wake

These commands change your position.  When you REST or SLEEP, you 
regenerate hit points, force points, and movement points faster.
However, you are more vulnerable to attack, and if you SLEEP,
you won't hear many things happen.

Use STAND or WAKE to come back to a standing position.  You can
also WAKE other sleeping characters.

101 RESTORE~
Syntax:  restore <victim>
Syntax:  restore all
 
Restore returns the victim to full hitpoints, force and movement.
 
Restore all can be done once per day (real time) by any Saint and above,
and will 'restore' every link-live player in the game.  Restore alls such
as this are limited to once every 6 hours, so if one Savior does one,
another cannot do one until 6 hours has passed, regardless of whether or
not they have not done one that day.
 
A Greater God or higher can do a restore all whenever they wish, and are
not constrained by the above limitations.
 
Use 'restoretime' to see when the last restore all was done.
 
See RESTORETIME

in a suction cup.  The suction cups are not vestigal, they can pick up
small objects in them and manipulate them quite well, although the suction
is not very strong. 
     They are among the Galaxy's best bounty hunters.  The history of Rodia
is peppered with wars and feuds, many of which were long and bloody.
Trained to fight from birth, they are amazingly agile and intelligent.
Though they almost never go into the scientific fields, their hand-to-hand
combat tactics are some of the best.  Rodians spread across the galaxy, far
and wide, seeking work as mercenaries, assassins, body guards, and

0 ROLEPLAY RP~
&c
Now that we have a bigger player base, we are starting to enforce RP. We
are nowhere near as strict as some muds; you can tell each other ooc and
talk in the same room, as long as this does not interfere with another
player who wishes to stay in character.  I have personally seen a few
people conversing, with one trying hard to roleplay while the other keeps
throwing in ooc comments, swearing, grinning stupidly, etc.  So have
respect for your fellow players.  The game is fun because of the
roleplaying, so keep in character as much as possible.  

The chat line is in character. I do not want to see someone mention ooc,
conventional words and items <modern slang, items like cars and
refridgerators, etc>.  If someone talks ooc on the chat line, call
him/her/it down on the ooc line, politely. I do
not want to see someone screaming "THAT SHOULD BE ON THE OOC LINE YOU DUMB
SUNOFAB*TCH!" like some people I know.
 
The OOC line is out of character.  I do not want people who are stunned
saying over the ooc line that they need an aid.  I do not want people who
need rides saying it over the ooc line.  I do not want people who do not
have comlinks talking over the ooc line ic.  I do not want people talking
over the ooc line because they cant understand each other's languages.
 
Read help ic.  It explains the difference between ooc and ic very
clearly.

head of the clan they are rping an escapee from. really, to rp any sort of
reject from any sort of clan, you should talk it over with the leader or a
high official of that clan. The roleplay is so much better that way, and
it avoids information problems.  Consider this a rule.

0 RP2~
What is roleplay?   Well its about time some of you asked. First, as
mentioned in help rp, rp is NOT discussing ooc stuff with your friends. 
It is not talking in a room about races or stats or ships or any other
code thing. Rp is NOT making a nice bio and desc and then doing socials
until you have gone through the list alphabetically. Rp is not becoming
the best code forcer/pilot/engineer etc. Now that we have covered some of
what rp is not,  we can get into what rp *is*. Roleplay is acting, in the
best sense.  It is creating a character, building it from the ground up in
regards to its history and personality.  It is finding a motivation for
that character, a reason for being, a purpose and goal. Roleplay is not
giving up when something bad happens, but instead incorporating that event
into the character and making it wiser and more interesting. Roleplay is
being a Jedi who is turned to the dark side by the loss of a loved one, or
greed, or hate. Roleplay is a BlackSun member conning a Rebel into giving
him all his money.  Roleplay is a Sith turning back to the Light, after
someone shows they care. Roleplay is a noghri who bows at the slightest
mention of the Empire.  Roleplay is being killed and your clone being a
bit nuts. Roleplay is falling in love, making mistakes, killing your
enemies, saving them if you are Jedi, creating small empires, having fun,
growing, building, dying. If perhaps all of this sounds a bit too lifelike
for you, and you cant take the idea of your character losing or dying,
then perhaps you need to reconsider mudding. We are not here to be the
interactive Phantom Menace game when you have beaten the computer game. We
are a mud.  A place of interacting with other people, acting and being
something we arent. Hopefully this helps.

&CSystem &W:&Y Ryloth
&CInhabitants &W:&W Twi'lek, Rycrit
&c
     This planet was the homeworld of the Twi'lek race, located in the 
Outer Rim Territories. It orbited its sun in such a way that one side 
was perpetually lit and the other was locked in the dark. The bright 
side generated huge heat storms which whipped around the planet and 
died on the night side, but not before warming the dark side up enough 
to support minimal life. It was a dry, rocky world with a thin, 
breathable atmosphere. The Twi'Leks there mine the mineral ryll for 
various legal and illegal uses throughout the galaxy. Ryloth was 
orbited by five, red-colored moons.

1 SAVE~
Syntax:  Save
 
SAVE saves your character and its inventory; you must be at least second

minute, but with the high number of players usually online it may take
hours before your own is auto-saved.  For this reason, you should not
rely on auto-save to keep your character updated -- save frequently.
 
Type SAVE immediately after recovering your corpse, gaining experience or
a level in battle, getting new items, making purchases or repairs, etc.
 
Some objects (such as keys) may not be saved.

1 SELONIAN SELONIANS~
&COrigin&W:&Y Selonia
&c
     One of the three primary races in the Corellian System, the 
Selonians are tall, strong, and quick. Often referred to as refined,
the Selonians are well-muscled and covered with short, sleek fur, 
giving them a seal-like appearance. They have bristly whiskers on their
noses, sharp teeth, and long tails. They are excellent swimmers. Taller
and more slender than humans, they have long bodies and short limbs. 
Selonians are equally comfortable walking upright or on all-fours. Each
hand or foot is equipped with retractable claws for climbing or 
defense. The Selonian race is believed to be descended from a predatory
aquatic mammal which lived in riverside burrows, but later dug deeper 
into the ground and farther from water. Each burrow is inhabited by all
members of a Selonian family; collectively, they are called a sept. ach
sept is distinguished by its lone ferile male breeder. This male, along
with the one fertile female, give birth to the sept's members. All male
Selonians are born fertile; one of every hundred Selonians born is a 
male. Of 500 female Selonians, only one will be fertile. These fertile
members of the sept, while revered for their fertility, are forced to
remain in the burrows. The sterile females run the day-to-day 
activities of the sept. Non-familial groupings of Selonians, such as
the government, are called dens. Each den is made up of sterile 
females. The Selonians have learned that dealing with other aliens,
especially humans, is dangerous. Thus, only specially-trained females
ever leave their burrows and contact the outside world. These females
learn Basic in addition to the normal conversational Selonian tongue.
All Selonians can also speak a modified language of sounds that is used
in their burrows. Its pure sounds are not affected by echoes or other 
auditory anomalies caused by the burrows.

101 SETBOOT~
Syntax: setboot time <hour> <minute>
 	setboot manual <0|1>

The setboot command is useful for planning a reboot, (to save you from 
the trouble of all those echos :) ) and for the daily boot.  The manual
bit is used by the mud to determine whether the boot time was set by 
hand.  When the mud starts up, the boot time is set to 0600hrs (6am)
and the manual bit to 0.  If 'setboot time' is used, the mud sets the
manual bit to 1.  When it comes time to do the reboot, the mud checks
how long it has been running.  If it has been running less than 18 
hours and the reboot time has not been set manually, the reboot does
not take place (nor do the automatic warning echoes).

Echoes: when a scheduled reboot is coming up, the mud will send out
echoes to that effect.  The echoes start 30 minutes before the reboot
and are repeated at t minus 15, 10, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 minute(s).

1 'SHIP DOCKING' DOCK DOCKING UNDOCK UNDOCKING~
&CSyntax &R&W: &YDock &R&W<&YShip&R&W>
&CSyntax &R&W: &YUndock 
 
&cShip docking has been completely revamped. 
You can dock any ship to a larger ship.  
A midship can dock 2 ships to it, a 
cap ship 3, a platform unlimited. 
HOWEVER, if you only have 1 ship docked to the midship, 
you can dock the midship to a cap ship... 2 ships 
can be docked to a cap ship, and you can still dock 
it to a platform. Ships can fire while docked, if they 
are pointed in that direction... autopilot will fire 
at your(the mothership) target as well! 
Ships docked to you will follow you into hyperspace, 
land with you, launch, etc. 
 
Board by itself will board whatever ship you are docked to atm. If you are
docked to more than one, board <ship>.

1 SHIPALARM SHIPALARMS~
&cPreviously, when a ship was unsuccessfully picked or successfully
hijacked, all players currently connected to the game were notified.
Furthermore, when a ship was unsucccessfully picked, the name of the
person who attempted to pick the ship was given. With the implementation of
the new ship alarm system, only the owner of a ship will be notified by
comlink of both successful and unsuccessful pick attempts and successful
hijack attempts on that ship, if an alarm is installed. (Hence, if the ship
has no alarm installed or the owner of the ship is not online, no one will
be notified of pick or hijack attempts.) A ship alarm costs 500k and can
be installed at the Space Garage. In the case of a clan being the owner of
a ship, all clan members online who can pilot clan ships, including the
leader, first and second, are considered the owner and will be notified as
described above.

similar to the new trajectory command. 
 
Activating shiptracking will initiate a program that  
jumps a ship along a certain course. It drops your ship 
out of hyperspace periodically, allowing you to  
check your radar.

1 SHIP_DESTRUCTION RULE_3~
&c
Destruction of ships must be done for IC reasons.  If you have a grudge
Against the owner, this is acceptable.  Destruction of a ship because 
You are a 'pirate' or a psycho, is not. A ship can not be blown up and
Then bought by the person or by a person who hired the person who 
Destroyed that ship, whatever the reason the ship was destroyed. 
Destroying a system hopper or another pubic ship should be done 
Only if all other possibilities have been exhausted.  Newbies fly these
Ships often, and we prefer them to remain alive to learn how to 'ID'.

Particular type removed from that player's ownership.

&c &cThose that choose the smuggling profession have many abilities that
others do not have.  The ability to pick doors, and even ships.  These,
coupled with the ability to hide and sneak by others, makes the smuggler a
popular choice.  Smuggling is basically getting illegal items from one
place to another without getting caught.

1 SULLUST~
&CSystem &W:&Y Sullust
&CInhabitants &W: Sullustan
&c
     Primary planet in the Sullust system, known for its mineral mines 
and technologies. It is a volcanically-active world with a hot, noxious 
atmosphere wracked by violent storms. Thus, the native Sullustans 
prefer to live underground, in the cool, humid caves that riddle the 
planet's mantle. There are also a number of underground lakes and 
caverns that support a surprising amount of life forms. The huge, 
diversified SoroSuub Corporation grew out of the caves, and when the 
Sullustan Council faltered, SoroSuub announced that it was aligned the 
planet with the Empire. Many of the working class Sullustans could not 
believe this, and a wave of Rebellion swept through the planet's 
inhabitants just before the Battle of Endor. It was then allowed to be 
the stop-over site for the massing Rebel fleet prior to the destruction
of the second Death Star. 
~

1 SULLUSTAN SULLUSTANS~
&COrigin&W:&Y Sullust
&c
Small, mouse-like aliens with huge black eyes, loose jowls, and pointed
ears. They salivate quite often, and live underground to avoid Sullust's
inhospitable atmosphere. Their ingenuity and adaptability has allowed them
to created huge underground cities and their technology has grown at an
incredibly fast rate. They have an intense sense of direction, having
lived in caves all their lives, and have the uncanny ability to remember a
path or map exactly, even after the first time they see it. Thus, many of
the Sullustans have become pilots and navigators. Many Sullustans, after
the age of 30 standard years, begin to experience corneal defects, and
must be fitted with special visors.

This helpfile, along with the help file 'Credits' listing the derivatives,
and all other help files required by each license supplied with this code,
must be included with each distribution.  Except for the 'credits' help
file, which can be added to, but not deleted, each of these files must be
kept intact as shipped. 
 
Any one who uses the SWRiP code should send an email to Darrik@swrip.net
informing him of this.  Once that has been done, he will assist you with
any problems you may have as his time allows. 
~

1 SWRIPC CHRONICLES~
&c
   The Star Wars : Rise In Power Chronicles, or SWRIPC, is an ongoing 
epic whose content is decided primarily by you, the active roleplayer. 
You see, SWRIPC is a story which is continuously updated to tell the  
story of the events which take place here, on RIP. This story revolves 
around a central group of characters from the MUD, which is always 
changing and evolving. This group interacts with others in strange and
destined ways, creating intruiging tangents and subplots for 
storylines. The SWRIPC also keeps a continuous eye on the ever 
struggling Rebel Alliance and the Empire, aswell as an idle 
eye on the Neutral clans, such as the Assassins Guild. This story will
be decided by three things. 
A) The emails you send me with ideas, suggestions, and events. 
B) The ideas I come up with to tie you all together.
C) The events of the MUD, such as deaths and conflicts.
 
   My email box is always open, and ready to receive ANY ideas or
suggestions you may have, and I always want to be updated about 
roleplay events and occurances. What if your character dies? No 
problem! Send me details of his death, and we'll make him go out in
style! In addition to this, at regular intervals, I'll be personally
selecting an organization or character that has shown excellant ideas,
initiative, or action in their roleplay and single him/her/them out in
an exclusive story I'll entitle "Tales of _________". For example, 
should someone, say Magellan, make a superbly impressive bounty and 
take someone out? "Tales of the Bounty Hunters : Volume I - Magellan's 
Hunt" would be released detailing a wonderful story about him and 
making him even more famous than he is! 
 
    So please, participate, because the SWRIPC is only as good as YOU 
MAKE IT! Email me, Caspian, at avatar.is@home.com with anything you 
want, even if it's just a question.

1 TATOOINE~
&CSystem &W:&Y Tatoo
&CInhabitants &W:&W Jawa, Sandpeople, Human
&c
     The primary planet in the Tatoo system, this desert world is 
located in the Arkanis Sector of the Outer Rim Territories near Piroket 
and Ryloth, some 43,000 light-years from the galactic core. It is close 
enough to a major hyperspace nexus to make it easy to get to such 
worlds as Coruscant and Corellia, but its environment makes it one of 
the most inhosptiable places in the galaxy. The planet's twin suns 
mercilessly heat the planet, keeping the sodium-rich deserts alive. The 
planet has a single, natural satellite. Several decades before the 
Battle of Yavin, settlers arrived to colonize this first world in what 
was then called the J11.9 system. They coined the name Tatooine from 
the Jawa name for the planet, Tah doo Een e. The settlers established 
strongholds on the planet, and many smugglers and criminals have set up 
operational bases in its wastelands. The settlers there are primarily 
moisture farmers, extracting what little water they can from the 
atmosphere for survival. Its location on the galactic fringes makes it 
a perfect base for smugglers, mercenaries, and bounty hunters. The 
planet, despite its hostile ecology, supports human life was well as 
the native races of Jawas, krayt dragons, and Tusken Raiders. The 
planet's remote location appealed to Owen Lars and his wife Beru, and 
they lived there with Luke Skywalker for many years. Tatooine's average 
day lasts 23 standard hours, and its year consumes 304 local days.

0 TICK~
Many of the actions in the game are based upon interval timers, including
combat, most autonomous monster actions, hp/force/move regeneration, power
duration, weather, and area resetting.
 
Of these timers, the hp/force/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks in the game average 30 seconds of real time, but the actual
amount varies randomly from 15 seconds to 45 seconds.
 
Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if there are no characters in
in the area; less often (15 minutes) if any characters are present.  Also
note that objects lying on the ground will not be regenerated if anyone
is in the area when it resets.
 
Area resets are indicated by 'squeaking noises' just prior to the reset.

that only certain triggers are allowed, and that if you are using triggers,
you are to be considered IC by any player to run into you. 
 
Also, titles must be seen by all players.  This means that several of the

1 TOGORIAN TOGORIANS~
&COrigin&W:&Y Togoria
&c
     A race of bipedal feline aliens from Togoria, the Togorians have 
long, sinewy limbs and well-muscled bodies that are equally useful 
moving through a forest or running across an open plain. Their hands 
and feet are studded with heavy claws, which are retractable on the 
hands. They regularly feed on bist and etelo herds, but are the favored
prey of the reptilian liphons. The Togorians soon realized that they 
shared this trait with the mosgoths, and they formed a relationship 
which provided mutual protection as well as friendship. The Togorians 
have a society in which the males and females only see each other for a
few days each year. The males spend their days wandering the plains and
hunting for food, while the females stay in the cities and tend to 
their business there. The Togorians have a limited technology, 
including a solar technology maintained by the females, although they 
are fond of high-tech devices. The Togorian society is presided over by
the Margrave, a position held by a male of a certain family line.

0 TRANDOSHAN TRANDOSHA DOSHA~
&COrigin: &YTrandosha

&c     These humanoid reptiles are natives to the planet Trandosha.  They
have long arms, which end in wide, splayed fingers.  Their heads are
blunt, with beady red eyes and a mouth full of razor sharp teeth.  Their
scales range in color from orange to ochre to brown.  Much of their body
can be regenerated if lost, so a Trandoshan can fight much harder without
risk of permanent injury.  Being a vicious, warlike race, the Trandoshans
evolved into hunters, and were especially proficient at hunting Wookiees,
which inhabited the nearby planet of Kashyyyk.  It was a Trandoshan
official who sold the idea of enslaving Wookiees rather than simply
leveling Kashyyyk to the Empire.

101 TRIGGER~
&c
A trigger is an action, phrase, or game event that causes a program
held within a room, mob or object, to begin playing out its commands.
 
Triggers can be anything from a player or mob entering a room, to a
player stating a particular phrase within a room, or to a mob or an
object.
 
For detailed information on triggers, see:

&RNote: &WIf we catch you idling to collect interest, there will be dire
consequences.

~

1 TRIGGERS~
Triggers are Illegal. This means nobody can idle collecting packages, and
hog them.
 
Anyone caught using Triggers will be dealt with however the Imms see fit.

A classic misunderstanding:
You may use triggers to train your stats such as wisdom, dexterity, etc.
That is perfectly legal.
~

101 'TRUE SIGHT'~
Syntax:  feel 'true sight'
 
This power can only be cast upon yourself.  It is a combination of
infravision (enabling you to see in the dark), detect invisible,
and detect hidden.  This power also allows you to see through
blinding attacks.
~

101 TRUST~
Syntax: trust <character> <level>

TRUST sets a character's trust to the specified level.  This is similar to
advancing the character for accessing immortal commands, but has no effect
on combat strength, et cetera.  You can give more trust to mortal (or
immortal) characters to give them access to more power without messing up
the character.  You can also restrict a player's trust to less than their
natural level.

A trust of 0 means to use the character's natural level again.

0 TWI'LEK TWI'LEKS TWILEK~
&pOrigin:&Y Ryloth

&P     A humanoid race with twin head tentacles.  The dual tail-like
appendages, called "lekku", grown out the backs of their heads are used
for communication with other Twi'leks.  Their language combines both a
spoken tongue along with the use of the lekku.  Native to the planet
Ryloth in the Outer Rim, they cultivate edible molds and fungi, and raise
cow-like rycrits for their meats and hides.  The species is not known for
violence, instead they prefer to use cunning aside from force.  Their
homeworld is known for the substance ryll, which has legitimate medical
use, but is vastly known for more dangerous addictive and recreational
reasons.  One hazard that the Twi'leks face on a regular basis is slavers,
who come to their world to fill their ships with Twi'lek slaves.

1 USE ACTIVATE~
&CSyntax &W:&Y Use (item)
 
Obviously lets you use the item.
~

101 USEPROG~
Syntax: opedit <object> <command> [number] [use_prog] [percentage]
 
The use_prog is an objtrigger that can be used in object programs.  The
use_prog will be executed when the item is used.  To define what will
trigger the use_prog, here is a list:

* Wands - when you zap
* Staves - when you brandish
* Food/pills - when you eat
* Blood/fountains/drink containers - when you drink
* Lights/armour/weapons - when you wear/wield/hold
* Potions - when you quaff
* Pipes - when you smoke
 
When the use_prog is executed you will not see the standard 'use message'
(ie You quaff a violet potion). What you will will be any mpechoes placed
in the program.  Also, any mobprog commands can be used in use_prog (see 
MPCOMMANDS).

**NOTE** The use_progs on lights, armour, and weapons are executed BEFORE
the player wears/holds/wields any item. Therefore, a mpforce to remove the
item will not work in the use_prog.  You will have to use a wear trigger
to accomplish this.
~

101 USERS~
Syntax: users <host ip>
Syntax: users <playername>

USERS reports all of the visible users connected to the server, including users
in the process of logging in.
If used with an argument, it will show all users from that host ip.
Shortforms of host will work -- e.x. 205, or 205.113, etc.
Shortened names will also work.  e.x., users fre would show
Fredrick and Fred if they were on at the time.
The first number, (desc), is the descriptor number that this user is on.
The second number is the user's connected state.  (See CONSTATES)
The third number is the number of seconds the user has been idle.
The fourth number is the remote TCP port on the user's host machine.
Next is the user's character name, then the user's host address.
(Usually the IP number as name resolving is normally disabled.)

The FORCECLOSE command can be used to force a connect to close by its
descriptor number.

1 VECTOR COURSE TRAJECTORY~
&CSyntax &W:&Y Course (x) (y) (z)
&c
This is used to adjust your course once inside a planatary
system so you may attack other craft or land.
 
This command takes an x, y and z as arguments. 
However, unlike before, these arguments are the  
difference between your current location and  
where you want to go.  The difference is seen in 
radar. Ships on radar show these coordinates, and 
the second set of coordinates for planets and other 
space objects show these. 
~

0 VENTRILOQUATE~
Syntax: feel ventriloquate <speaker> <message>

This power throws your voice, making it appear that some other object or
character in the room is saying your message.  Victims who make their saving
throw will know that someone is using ventriloquism, but not who.  Victims who
fail their saving throw will think that the object or character really did say
your message.

0 VERPINE VERPINES~
&COrigin&W:&Y Roche Asteroid Field 
 
&c     Verpine are an advanced species of bipedal insectoids.  Their thin,
sticklike bodies have awkwardly articulated joints and chitnous shells. 
Two antennae jut from the sides of their heads, which have two large eyes
and short snouts.  The Verpine live in the Roche Asteroid Field, using
great repulsor shells to keep occupied asteroids from crashing into each
other and to deflect other bits of space debris.  They are innate experts
in most fields of technology, and their childlike fascination with all
types of machinary have served them well.  They hollow out the asteroids
for use as colonies, sealing them against space and filling them will all
kinds of technological wonders.  Verpine have developed into expert
starship builders.  The Slayn and Korpil Corporation, named for two
neighboring Verpine colonies, have been well known and respected since the
days of the Old Republic.

then vote on the issue in the note with &YNOTE VOTE <number>
YES/NO/ABSTAIN.&c The author may close the voting; the syntax for that
should be clear enough.
 
&YNOTE LIST&c will show whether a note is not a voting note, open to
voting, or closed to voting.  The character that seperates the author and
the recipient in &YNOTE LIST&c will be a colon, a capital V or a capital C
accordingly.
~

101 VSEARCH~
Syntax:  vsearch <vnum of target object>
 
Returns all instances of the target object presently in the game, as
well as their level.  Allows location of objects via vnum instead of

2 WAR WARTALK~
&CSyntax &W:&Y war <message>
&c
Wartalk is a channel created as a haven for those players who like to openly
discuss their exploits in combat - and brag against their opponents.  It is
most often used for those who declare war on other deadlies and is desirable
for those who like to invite others to battles in player versus player
whether it be in the arena or around the Realms.
 
Wartalk can be seen by all players in the game, and has the same
rules as other channels.  No harassment, profanity, spamming, or
inappropriate subject matter.

inhabitable. The planet measured some 192,478 kilometers in diameter, 
and the atmosphere which surrounds it had an average depth of 65,000 
kilometers. The density of its core gave Yavin a gravity which is 2.74 
times the standard of Coruscant, and helped the gas giant to attract so 
many moons. Despite the intense pressures within the clouds, Yavin 
supported lifeforms which were thinner than paper but nonetheless 
alive.

1 YEVETHAN~
&COrigin&W:&Y N'zoth
&c
a humanoid alien race which resemble skeletons. Their facial structure
is highly colored, with a white nasal ridge and scarlet cheek and chin 
ridges surrounding dark black eyes. The Yevetha have six clawed fingers 
on each hand, and a wicked dewclaw could be extended from their wrists. 
They are a very self-important race, and consider all other races to be 
vermin. The Yevetha have a hierarchical society, with the males being 
dominant. There are castes of males and females, and the higher classes 
alway dominate the lower. Lower-ranking Yevethan males must bear their 
necks in deferrence to their superiors. Yevetha are also extrememly 
quick to learn about new things, and are particularly adept at 
assimilating technology. They never eat in mixed company, and detest 
the smell and feel of other races. They have installed specialized 
bathing stations on their embassy ships, to wash away the scent 
of other races. The Yevetha originally came from the planet N'zoth, and 
had populated the nearest worlds when the Empire subjugated them and 
used the Koornacht Cluster as a base of operations for the Black Sword 
Command. Under the guidance of Nil Spaar, the Yevetha overthrew the 
Imperials following the Galactic Civil War, and created plans to purge 
the Koornacht - and eventually the galaxy - of non-Yevethans. This plan 
became known as the Great Purge, and was initiated about twelve years 
after their defeat of the Empire.
