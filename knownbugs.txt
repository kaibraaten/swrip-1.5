* do_reply does not check for the presence of a comlink.

* show_members() in clans.c: Sorted member data allocated but never
  freed, causing memory leak every time the function is called.

* parse_target() in interp.c allocates strings with strdup, but the
  memory doesn't appear to be freed anywhere. Investigate.
