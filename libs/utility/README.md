# The utility library

All the original code that was independent on the actual game
code has been moved here. All this code can be used in any
other project without alteration.

Some of it is original SWRiP code (although usually modified)
and some of it is my code. I haven't marked what code is mine,
and therefore everything is bound by the SWRiP license.
