# Scripts

The scripts in this directory come in two flavors. Scripts that
are used at compile time, and scripts that are used at runtime.

What is important to know is that none of these scripts have anything
to do with mudprogs in the game. Instead, mudprogs are saved in
the area files and in ``data/scripts/``.
